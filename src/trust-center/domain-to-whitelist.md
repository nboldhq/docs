# Domain to whitelist

At nBold, trust is our #1 value.  
  
We understand that our customers need to be confident that they are communicating with nBold in a secure environment. Domain's whitelisting is one of the most effective methods of ensuring this and prevents any internet traffic intended for nBold from being hijacked or rerouted to a rogue website.

Our complete portfolio of domains is outlined below for our customers to reference when establishing and maintaining their corporate network and email settings.
