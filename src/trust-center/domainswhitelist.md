# Domains to Whitelist

We understand that our customers need to be confident that they are communicating with nBold in a secure environment. Domains whitelisting is one of the most effective methods of ensuring this and prevents any internet traffic intended for nBold from being hijacked or rerouted to a rogue website.  
Our complete portfolio of domains are outlined below to help our customers configure their corporate web proxy.

::: tip Note
This information is subject to change and we recommend that you check back quarterly for the addition of new domains.
