## 1. Create a Team that will be the Original Team for the template

1. Create a Team using the regular way and name it "NAME OF THE USE CASE - Template" (Deal Room - Template; Construction Site - Template; Marketing Department - Template; Project Management - Template... )
2. Add the different Channels you want.
3. Add files and folders in Files Tab
4. Add the different Website tabs to refer to any Intranet Page, Website or WebApp Application (must be in _https://_)
5. Add Planner in the relevant channels with Predefined Tasks, Checklist, Description, Labels and Buckets
6. Add an image to this Team in Jpeg
7. Remove all the wiki tabs from the channels created
8. Add the nBold Service Account as an owner of the Team

  _For IOS devices, type "Control" + "Command" +"Space"._
