# What happens if the Template is changed?

We always have this question: "what if I change the Microsoft Teams Template, will it change all the Teams already created with this Template?".

When [you build a Collaboration Template with nBold ](https://docs.nbold.co/collaboration-templates/create-a-new-collaboration-template.html)there are two main parts: the original team that will be replicated and the associated governance policies. When a change is made to one of these two pieces, here is what won't affect or will affect the formerly created teams linked to the Template:

Will change for the Teams created **in the past** and **in the future**:

* [Permanent Members and Permanent Owners](https://help.salestim.com/en/articles/4149874-permanent-owners-and-members-policy)
