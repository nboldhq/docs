Now you can deploy Microsoft Forms at scale in your organization through Collaboration templates!  
  
Let's say you have a Collaboration template "GDPR Data erasure request", pre-filled with reference 📚 documents about GDPR, and 📅 Planner tasks that needs to be fulfilled.  
To include your form, just add a new 📋 Microsoft Forms tab in your template team:

Note that you can include your forms in two ways:

* "Collect responses": Ready to be filled form
* "Show results": Shows a summary of responses
