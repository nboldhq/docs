## Step 1: Create the Original Team of the Collaboration Template

1\. **Create a new team** using the regular way, from "Join or Create Team" in Teams.

2\. **Name it** "Store Opening"- Template" for example.

3\. **Add the different channels**, here is a suggested list:

* 💰 Budget
* 📅 Planning
* 📊 Review
* 🖌 Design
* 🗓 Weekly Meetings

You can frame the channels the way you want, based on your need.

4\. **Add Websites Tabs** in every channel needed, you can bring any content that comes with a URL to the Team created. The content can be any information that you would like to share with your team members.

* Guidelines on Internet or intranet
* Link to a share-point online documentation library
* Internal web-based application

5\. **Create a Planner** with the list of tasks that you need to carry out. Few examples that can be:

* Preparation (Prepare or design a document, Setup preparation planning, Follow up)
* Work (Monthly reviews with contractors, weekly team follow up, weekly contactor follow up)
* Finalization (Communication Plan, Final contractors work list)

_Planner is currently replicated in the inverse. So, for Planner you need to create the tasks displayed in the opposite of what you want to show in the Teams that will be created from the template._
