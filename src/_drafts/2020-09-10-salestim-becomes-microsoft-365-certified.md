# SalesTim is now the first and the only one Microsoft Teams governance app certified for Microsoft 365
<BlogHeadline />

## Why all these investments in compliance and security?

Since the birth of SalesTim, we firmly believe that success is built on trust, and that trust starts with transparency. This commitment to protecting our customers data and respecting the privacy of their individuals is rooted in our values and guides all our actions.

As a first incarnation of these principles, and very early while building the foundations of this company, we created our [Trust Center](https://developers.salestim.com/platform/). From this website, our prospects and customers have been able to discover and evaluate what kind of data we were accessing, processing, storing, using which formal process, and how we were ensuring both the compliance of our operations and the security of their data.

This unprecedented transparency helped us to earn the trust from major corporate and enterprise companies, and to create a virtuous circle of conversation comprised of frequent feedback and improvements.

But at some point, we realized that these one-one conversations were not enough, and that we had to move forward and involve another organization as a trusted third-party that would bring an additional level of guarantee. Could-you imagine a better one that Microsoft?

***That's why today we're so excited to celebrate that SalesTim is now the first and the only Microsoft Teams governance app certified for Microsoft 365!***

## Our journey through the Microsoft 365 App Compliance Program 

The [Microsoft 365 App Compliance Program](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-app-certification/overview) is a long-term initiative from Microsoft, that aims to bring customers a complete trust in the applications that run their enterprise.  With the tremendous increase of usage of Microsoft 365, especially Microsoft Teams and it's third-party apps, it makes perfect sense for Microsoft to work with app publishers to bring an additional level of trust.

This program is comprised of three layers, that we've been through for the past feaw months:

1. The Publisher Verification helps admins and end users understand the authenticity of application developers integrating with the Microsoft identity platform.

For instance, when you're installing SalesTim in your Microsoft Teams environment, a Microsoft 365 administrator has to approve the Microsoft Graph permissions that we're requesting. During this "Admin Consent" process, our customers can now be sure that the package they're installing is really from us through the small blue badge next to our website URL:

2. The Publisher Attestation is where developers share general, data handling, and security and compliance information pertaining to their app ecosystems.

You can see the [SalesTim Publisher Attestation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365-app-certification/teams/salestim) from the Microsoft 365 App Compliance Program website. These information are also available from [Microsoft Cloud App Security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise-mobility-security/cloud-app-security) and from the Microsoft Teams Admin Center:

3. M365 Certification
The M365 Certification offers assurance and confidence to enterprise organizations that data and privacy are adequately secured and protected when using Microsoft Teams apps.

This certification from Microsoft of the SalesTim app confirms that it is fully compatible with Microsoft technologies, compliant with cloud app security best practices, and supported by Microsoft. To achieve this certification, the SalesTim development team worked with a third-party assessor to validate organizational security and compliance standards.

## Our commitments to compliance and security
As we're always looking for new ways to improve our security posture and to share best practices, in addition to this formal certification process, we took several new measures:

Public automated sec tests reports


## Next steps

If you've already been involved in such a certification process, you know that this is more a starting point than an end. Also, we know that security relies on several pillars:
- We stay modest, accepting that we'll always have something new to learn and improve
- We believe in transparency, and don't practice security through obscurity, therefore we'll continue to make public any information related to the security of our platform.
