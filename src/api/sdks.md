# API SDKs <Badge text="beta" type="warning"/>

**ABSTRACT**  
The nBold API SDKs are designed to simplify building high-quality, efficient, and resilient applications that access the nBold API.  
The service library contains models and request builders that are generated from the nBold API metadata to provide a rich, strongly typed, and discoverable experience when working with the many datasets available in the nBold API.

To learn more about the nBold API, see [API Reference](https://docs.nbold.co/api) or try it online with our [API Explorer](https://docs.nbold.co/api/explorer).
