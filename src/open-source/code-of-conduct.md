# Open Source Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in open source communities we're managing, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

Our open source communities strive to:

- **Be friendly and patient**: Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
- **Be welcoming**: Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
- **Be respectful**: We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:
  - Violent threats or language.
  - Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
  - Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  - Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  - Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
  - Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
  - Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
- **Understand disagreements**: Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all repos and communities for open source projects we're managing regardless of whether or not the repo explicitly calls out its use of this code. The code also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing a project or its community. Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Reporting issues

We encourage all communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible. This builds a broader and deeper understanding and ultimately a healthier interaction. In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please feel free to report your concerns by contacting [codeofconduct@nbold.co](mailto:codeofconduct@nbold.co). Your report will be handled in accordance with the issue resolution process described in this document.

In your report please include:
- Your contact information.
- Names (real, usernames or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.
- Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public chat log), please include a link or attachment.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

All reports will be reviewed by a multi-person team and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Where additional perspectives are needed, the team may seek insight from others with relevant expertise or experience. The confidentiality of the person reporting the incident will be kept at all times. Involved parties are never part of the review team.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the review team may take any action they deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.

This code of conduct is based on the template established by the [TODO Group](http://todogroup.org/) and used by numerous other large communities (e.g., [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/), [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/pages/876921332402685/open-source-code-of-conduct), Twitter, GitHub and the Scope section from the [Contributor Covenant version 1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).

## FAQ

### Why have a code of conduct?

People and communities are the foundation of open source. Communities thrive through diversity of thought and the safety of its members. We have a deep-seated commitment to diversity and inclusion. All our employees enjoy a safe work environment and a culture of mutual respect and responsibility. Our team members and open source partners should enjoy the same environment when collaborating on open source projects.

While conduct issues seldom arise, when they do, they are often very public and very passionate. It is best for the community to be prepared with:

- A clear and accessible Code of Conduct stating the norms under which projects operate
- An Issue Resolution Process for addressing cases where these norms are not being maintained

Our code of conduct captures our culture of equality, respect and inclusion. This same template is used by industry colleagues such as Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, Yahoo and others in their open source projects.

### Why do this across all repos?

Having one code and process is both efficient and consistent — community members can participate in any project we're driving and be confident that they know the norms and that they are supported by a robust process.

### How does a project adopt the code and process?

All our projects are automatically covered by the Code of Conduct and the Issue Resolution Process. However, it is critical that everyone in the communities be aware of the code and process. For that reason, all projects must link to the Code of Conduct in their `README`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` and `CONTRIBUTING` files using the following mentions:

```markdown
# Code of Conduct
This project has adopted the [nBold Open Source Code of Conduct](https://docs.nbold.co/open-source/code-of-conduct).
```

### How do I raise a concern?

If you have witnessed or been subjected to a violation of the Code of Conduct, please send an email to [codeofconduct@nbold.co](mailto:codeofconduct@nbold.co). Your message will be handled in a secure and confidential manner. This email address is monitored by people who are not active in open source projects or communities — so you can be sure that you are not communicating with a person involved in the issue you are reporting. You will receive a response within one business day acknowledging receipt of your email and describing the process for its resolution. (See below for more details.)

### What is the process for addressing issues that arise?

Emails sent to [codeofconduct@nbold.co](mailto:codeofconduct@nbold.co) kick off the following process:
- Your message will be acknowledged within one business day.
- Within the following business days, a small, 2-3, person team will be assembled from a pool of our employee volunteers to review your concern. This team will be as diverse as possible given its size and will pull in additional people as needed to gain further insight and provide guidance. The team will not include anyone directly involved in the issue that has been raised.
- From there team will work with you and the others involved to come to a conclusion. While issue complexity varies, the goal is to resolve issues within five working days.
- All communication will be confidential with very limited circulation.

### How does the resolution team work?

Beyond the norms and values set out in the Code of Conduct, issue review teams operate under the following principles:
- **Less is more** — As much as possible, let the community work it out. It is much better to have communities self-correct than to have outsiders come in and “fix” problems.
- **Equality** — Contribution value or status in the community are not relevant to the review. Key people do not have more rights (either to abuse or be protected from abuse) than others in the community.
- **Independence** — Reviewers must act and be seen to act with independence from the project(s) in question and from our company.

### Can I use this Code of Conduct in my projects?

Yes. The document is licenced under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0). You will of course need to update the document to suit the specifics of your projects, but by all means use this however you can to drive great communities.
