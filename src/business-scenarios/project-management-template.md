Introduction

The objective of the article is to present, how collaboration with Microsoft Teams templates can help an organization optimize any Project. Project Management is a Collaborative Process and Teams is the perfect home for that. With a Template, you can address this process at scale in your organization.

***

## Step 1: Create the Original Team of the Collaboration Template

1\. **Create a new team** using the regular way, from "Join or Create Team" in Teams.

2\. **Name it** "Project Management - Template" for example.

3\. **Add the different channels**, here is a suggested list:

* 💰 Budget
* 📅 Planning
* 📈 Business Case
* 📊 Steering Committee
* 📝 Contractors
* 🗓 Team Meetings
* 🤣 Team life and fun
* 😃 People and Management

You can frame the channels the way you want, based on your need.

4\. **Add Websites Tabs** in every channel needed, you can bring any content that comes with a URL to the Team created. The content can be any information that you would like to share with your team members.

* Guidelines on Internet or intranet
* Link to a share-point online documentation library
* Internal web-based application

5\. **Create a Planner** with the list of tasks that you need to carry out. Few examples that can be:

* Planning (Upgradation of brand name and color palette, add customer quotes and Testimonials)
* Milestones (First International office opening, outsource building the Android and IOS application)
* Next Steps (Find a venture for the next party, Revise the employee handbook)

_Planner is currently replicated in the inverse. So, for Planner you need to create the tasks displayed in the opposite of what you want to show in the Teams that will be created from the template._

6\. Also, add a profile image to the Original Team, this image will be replicated to each Team Created.

It's done!

## Step 2: Adding Collaboration template to a corporate catalog

2\. **Click on the 'Create'** option present on the top right corner and select the team to be cloned, which in this case is "Project Management"

3\. **In the Info tab**, fill in the name of the original team which is named "Project Management - Template" Microsoft Team name and description. You also have the ability to choose the desired Microsoft Teams Template language.

4\. **In the Name Tab,** set up the name of the Team that will be created from the Template:

* **Default Team Name** (what user will fill in the request form): this can be the _Name of the Project_
* **Naming Convention** (the name automatically generated): this can be _<%=_ [_request.team.name_](http://request.team.name/) _%> - Project_
* **Default Teams description:** Enter Additional Project Description
* **Business Solution Description:** this can be _Team dedicated to collaborate around the Project: <%=_ [_request.team.name_](http://request.team.name/) _%> | Location: <%= user.msCountry %> | Created by: <%=_ [_request.request.requester.name_](http://request.request.requester.name/) _%> with the job role: <%= user.msJobTitle%> | <%= request.team.description %>_
* Same Idea with the welcome message!

5. **In the Approval tab**, define the approval policy with an approver from your organization.


6.  **In the Audience tab**, define the audience you wish to target for this Microsoft Teams Template.


7. **In the Compliance tab,** define sensitivity labels applied to each team created from the template to protect your data.
