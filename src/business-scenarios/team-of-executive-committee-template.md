## Introduction

The objective of the article is to present, how collaboration with Microsoft Teams templates can help an organization optimize the collaboration in an Executive Committee Team. Formation of Executive Committee is a Collaborative Process and Teams is the perfect home for that. With a Template, you can address this process at scale in your organization.

***

### Step 1: Create the Original Team of the Collaboration Template

1\. **Create a new team** using the regular way, from "Join or Create Team" in Teams.

2\. **Name it** "Team of Executive Committee - Template" for example.

3\. **Add the different channels**, here is a suggested list:

* 📅 Planning
* 📈 Finance
* 📢 Internal Communication
* 📜 Company News
* 🔭 Market Watch
* 🗓 Weekly Meeting
* 🤝 Partners
* 🛫Corporate Strategy

You can frame the channels the way you want, based on your need.

4\. **Add Websites Tabs** in every channel needed, you can bring any content that comes with a URL to the Team created. The content can be any information that you would like to share with your team members.

* Guidelines on Internet or intranet
* Link to a share-point online documentation library
* Internal web-based application

5\. **Create a Planner** with the list of tasks that you need to carry out. Few examples that can be:

* Communication with CEO (Weekly dialogue, Communication Report and Communication)
* Organizational Oversight (Formation of Committees and Task force, good governance practices)
* Strategy Design (Swot Analysis, Access Competitors)

_Planner is currently replicated in the inverse. So, for Planner you need to create the tasks displayed in the opposite of what you want to show in the Teams that will be created from the template._

6\. Delete all the Wiki Tabs in each Channel. Otherwise, Microsoft will create two.

7\. Also, add a profile image to the Original Team, this image will be replicated to each Team Created.

It's done!

### Step 2: Adding Collaboration template to a template catalog

1\. **Add the Original Team to the Catalog**: for this, you need to be logged in as a global admin. Go to Catalog Tab in nBold App and look for the team you created i.e. "Team of Executive Committee - Template.

2\. **Click on the '+ New template'** option present on the top right corner and select the team to be cloned, which in this case is "Team of Executive Committee"

3\. **In the Info tab**, fill in the name of the original team which is named "Team of Executive Committee - Template" and description. You also have the ability to choose the desired Collaboration Template language.

4\. **In the Naming Tab,** set up the name of the Team that will be created from the Template:

* **Default Team Name** (what user will fill in the request form): this can be _Name of the Team_
* **Naming Convention** (name automatically generated): this can be _<%=_ [_request.team.name_](http://request.team.name) _%> - Exec Committee_
* **Default Teams description:** Enter Additional Team Description
* **Business Solution Description:**  this can be _Team dedicated to collaboration around the Team: <%=_ [_request.team.name_](http://request.team.name) _%> | Location: <%= user.msCountry %> | Created by: <%=_ [_request.request.requester.name_](http://request.request.requester.name) _%> with the job role: <%= user.msJobTitle%> | <%= request.team.description %>_
* Same Idea with the welcome message!

5\. **In the Approval tab**, define the approval policy with an approver from your organization.

7\. **In the Audience tab**, define the audience you wish to target for this Collaboration Template.

8\. **In the Security tab**, define the Security Policy with:

* Teams Privacy enforcement (to Private for example)
* Permanent Owners
* Permanent Members

***

### Step 3: Try It 🚀

1. Once the Collaboration Template named 'Team of Executive Committee - Template' is created, go to the 'Home' tab and select the template to create a new team.
2. Name the Team and add a description to it. Add a welcome message that you want to be seen by the members of the team when they join the Team.
3. Within seconds, your Team matching your business need is up and running.

_If you are doing that with a service account, no notification will be seen because you are the account that is creating the Team._
