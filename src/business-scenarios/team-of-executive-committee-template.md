### Introduction

The objective of the article is to present, how collaboration with Microsoft Teams templates can help an organization optimize the collaboration in an Executive Committee Team. Formation of Executive Committee is a Collaborative Process and Teams is the perfect home for that. With a Template, you can address this process at scale in your organization.

***

### Step 1: Create the Original Team of the Collaboration Template

1\. **Create a new team** using the regular way, from "Join or Create Team" in Teams.

2\. **Name it** "Team of Executive Committee - Template" for example.

3\. **Add the different channels**, here is a suggested list:

* 📅 Planning
* 📈 Finance
* 📢 Internal Communication
* 📜 Company News
* 🔭 Market Watch
* 🗓 Weekly Meeting
* 🤝 Partners
* 🛫Corporate Strategy

You can frame the channels the way you want, based on your need.

4\. **Add Websites Tabs** in every channel needed, you can bring any content that comes with a URL to the Team created. The content can be any information that you would like to share with your team members.

### Step 2: Adding Collaboration template to a template catalog

1. **Add the Original Team to the Catalog**: for this, you need to be logged in as a global admin. Go to Catalog Tab in nBold App and look for the team you created i.e. "Team of Executive Committee - Template.
2. **Click on the '+ New template'** option present on the top right corner and select the team to be cloned, which in this case is "Team of Executive Committee"
3. **In the Info tab**, fill in the name of the original team which is named "Team of Executive Committee - Template" and description. You also have the ability to choose the desired Collaboration Template language.
4. **In the Naming Tab,** set up the name of the Team that will be created from the Template:
   * **Default Team Name** (what user will fill in the request form): this can be the _Name of the Team_


   * **Naming Convention** (name automatically generated): this can be _<%=_ [_request.team.name_](http://request.team.name) _%> - Exec Committee_


   * **Default Teams description:** Enter Additional Team Description


   * **Business Solution Description:**  this can be _Team dedicated to collaboration around the Team: <%=_ [_request.team.name_](http://request.team.name) _%> | Location: <%= user.msCountry %> | Created by: <%=_ [_request.request.requester.name_](http://request.request.requester.name) _%> with the job role: <%= user.msJobTitle%> | <%= request.team.description %>_


   * Same Idea with the welcome message!


5. **In the Approval tab**, define the approval policy with an approver from your organization.
6. **In the Audience tab**, define the audience you wish to target for this Microsoft Teams Template.
7. **In the Compliance tab,** define sensitivity labels applied to each team created from the template to protect your data.
8. **In the Security tab**, define the Security Policy with:

* Teams Privacy enforcement (to Private for example)
