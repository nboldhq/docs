The thing you need to know before proceeding is that you can't restrict people to create Teams only. If you want to do so you would restrict the creation of Office 365 Groups for users, meaning: teams, Planner, Outlook Groups, Yammer Connecter Groups, etc. How can I implement that?​ Following this documentation by Microsoft, you'll be able to set only a group user (based on a security group) who will be able to create Office 365 and therefore teams, through the regular way.

Please make sure that the Service Account is belonging to the security group that can create Office 365 Group in the tenant.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Delegate Roles","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/administrator-guide/delegate-template-catalog-administration","content":"Delegate Roles You don't need to be a Microsoft 365 Global Administrator to create, manage and delete templates.

When throttling occurs, nBold API returns HTTP status code 429 (Too many requests), and the requests fail. Throttling limits the number of concurrent calls to a service to prevent overuse of resources. nBold API is designed to handle a high volume of requests. If an overwhelming number of requests occurs, throttling helps maintain optimal performance and reliability of the nBold API service. Throttling limits vary based on the scenario. For example, if you are performing a large volume of writes, the possibility for throttling is higher than if you are only performing reads. nBold API is conforming to the IETF ratelimit standardization proposal. 💡 Note: Throttling behavior can depend on the type and number of requests. For example, if you have a high volume of requests, all requests types are throttled. Threshold limits vary based on the request type.

When you implement error handling, use the HTTP error code 429 to detect throttling. The failed response includes the Retry-After response header.

Wait the number of seconds specified in the Retry-After header.Retry the request.If the request fails again with a 429 error code, you are still being throttled. Continue to use the recommended Retry-After delay and retry the request until it succeeds. 💡 Note: If no Retry-After header is provided by the response, we recommend implementing an exponential backoff retry policy.

Permissions","url":"/trust-center/microsoft-graph-permissions#service-account","content":"A service account is a user identity that is associated with a service executable (such as nBold) for the purpose of providing a security context for that service. Why do we NEED a service account? nBold relies intensively on the Microsoft Graph API. Therefore it's important to understand its permissions model and basic requirements. Understand delegated and application permissions Microsoft Graph has two types of permissions: Delegated permissions are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests and the app can act as the signed-in user when making calls to Microsoft Graph. Some delegated permissions can be consented by non-administrative users, but some higher-privileged permissions require administrator consent.Application permissions are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present. For example, apps that run as background services or daemons. Application permissions can only be consented by an administrator. tip Due to some Microsoft Graph functional and technical limitations, nBold now relies on a delegated permission model. In the future, nBold will switch to an application model. Learn more about Authentication and authorization basics for Microsoft Graph... How we're securing it?

MFA adds an additional layer of protection, ensuring that service account declaration or update is done by an authorized person. Password update and MFA (Multi-factor authentication) If you enforce MFA for the service account or update its password AFTER it has been configured in nBold, you MUST update it from the &quot;Settings&quot; tab using the &quot;🎭 Update&quot; button. Keep access limited​ Ensure you only allocate AD service accounts the minimum privileges they require for the tasks they need to carry out, and don’t give them any more access than is necessary. In many cases you can remove the functionality for remote access, terminal service login, internet access, and remote control rights. Create service accounts from scratch​ Don’t create service accounts in Active Directory by copying old ones, as you might accidentally be copying from a service account with much higher privileges than you need. This could lead to security issues and account misuse if you give someone an account with access to resources or information they shouldn’t be privy to. Don’t put service accounts in built-in privileged groups​ Putting service accounts in groups with built-in privileges can be risky, because each person in the group will have access to the service account’s credentials. If there’s account misuse, it can be hard to figure out who the offender is. If you need a service account for a privileged group, create a new group with the same privileges and allow access only to the service account. Control password configuration​ You can set a service account so the user can’t change their own password. You can also set it so the account can’t be delegated to someone else. This ensures the administrator controls the password, and nobody other than authorized users has access to the account. Enable auditing​ Be sure to enable auditing for all service accounts and related objects. Once auditing is enabled, regularly check the logs to see who’s using the accounts, when, and for what purposes. Auditing is one of the most important of the best practices: it helps ensure security, verifies internal processes and compliance measures are being followed, and can discover any issues or breaches before too much time passes. You can leverage multiple sources of reports and audits: Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams reports: As a regular user, some aspects of the service account activity are available from the standard Microsoft 365 reports and Microsoft Teams reports. This is especially useful to monitor the overall level of activity to detect unusual patterns (external file sharing, downloads...). N.B: These reports are also available from Power BI.Microsoft 365 Defender: Detailed audit trails are accessible from the Microsoft 365 Defender portalAzure AD: From the [AAD portal)(https://aad.portal.azure.com), you have access to both signin-logs and audit logsnBold: nBold provides its own trails of all the operations performed by the service account, especially through the provisioning audit trails. These audits trails could be integrated with an SIEM solution such as Microsoft Sentinel for automated analysis and patterns recognition. Implement access rights management software​ Carefully managing your Active Directory service accounts is crucial to preventing misuse of broad access and privileges. An access rights management tool can be beneficial to ensure user accounts are set up and managed with appropriate permissions and access.

These best practices are gounded by the OWASP Security Design Principles: Minimize attack surface area : The aim for secure development is to reduce the overall risk by reducing the attack surface area.Establish secure defaults: By default, the experience should be secure, and it should be up to the user to reduce their security – if they are allowed.Principle of Least privilege: The principle of least privilege recommends that accounts have the least amount of privilege required to perform their business processes. See Microsoft Graph Permissions as an example.Principle of Defense in depth: The principle of defense in depth suggests that where one control would be reasonable, more controls that approach risks in different fashions are better.Fail securely: Applications regularly fail to process transactions for many reasons. How they fail can determine if an application is secure or not.Don’t trust services: Many organizations utilize the processing capabilities of third party partners, who more than likely have differing security policies and posture than you. Therefore, implicit trust of externally run systems is not warranted. All external systems should be treated in a similar fashion.Separation of duties: Certain roles have different levels of trust than normal users. In particular, administrators are different to normal users. In general, administrators should not be users of the application.Avoid security by obscurity: Security through obscurity is a weak security control, and nearly always fails when it is the only control.Keep security simple: Developers should avoid the use of double negatives and complex architectures when a simpler approach would be faster and simpler.Fix security issues correctly: Once a security issue has been identified, it is important to develop a test for it, and to understand the root cause of the issue. When design patterns are used, it is likely that the security issue is widespread amongst all code bases, so developing the right fix without introducing regressions is essential.Secure Release Process: Aside from the Secure Development Principles, we're using several tools during our release process as a gateway before each release and deployment, to reduce risks and avoid common pitfalls.

Using this communication channel (english as a preferred languages), we will be able privately discuss and fix the security vulnerability. ❌ Never use any other communication channel to report a security vulnerability ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Vulnerability disclosure policy​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Security policy","url":"/trust-center/security-policy#vulnerability-disclosure-policy","content":"We believe that vulnerability disclosure is a two-way street. Vendors, as well as researchers, must act responsibly. This is why we adheres to a 90-day disclosure deadline. We notify vendors of vulnerabilities immediately, with details shared in public with the defensive community after 90 days, or sooner if the vendor releases a fix. That deadline can vary in the following ways: If a deadline is due to expire on a weekend or US public holiday, the deadline will be moved to the next normal work day.Before the 90-day deadline has expired, if a vendor lets us know that a patch is scheduled for release on a specific day that will fall within 14 days following the deadline, we will delay the public disclosure until the availability of the patch.When we observe a previously unknown and unpatched vulnerability in software under active exploitation (a “0day”), we believe that more urgent action—within 7 days—is appropriate. The reason for this special designation is that each day an actively exploited vulnerability remains undisclosed to the public and unpatched, more devices or accounts will be compromised. Seven days is an aggressive timeline and may be too short for some vendors to update their products, but it should be enough time to publish advice about possible mitigations, such as temporarily disabling a service, restricting access, or contacting the vendor for more information. As a result, after 7 days have elapsed without a patch or advisory, we will support researchers making details available so that users can take steps to protect themselves. As always, we reserve the right to bring deadlines forwards or backwards based on extreme circumstances. We remain committed to treating all vendors strictly equally. We expects to be held to the same standard. This policy is strongly in line with our desire to improve industry response times to security bugs, but also results in softer landings for bugs marginally over deadline. Creating pressure towards more reasonably-timed fixes will result in smaller windows of opportunity for blackhats to abuse vulnerabilities. In our opinion, vulnerability disclosure policies such as ours result in greater overall safety for users of the Internet.

Instead of a simple message, the error display lot of interesting information regarding the infrastructure of CosmoDB and the Azure Storage. This could be useful to perform another attack like SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).Example of POST request sent to the server with a bad value in “user%5Bid%5D=”: Implementation: Returned errors from CosmosDB are not returned anymore, replaced by custom one fixed: #security [INFODISC02] The endpoint “/refreshToken” send a JWT token in GET #565 Rationale: During the audit of uat.salestim.io, SYNETIS auditors have identified a medium vulnerability, which could be dangerous if the request was intercepted or if the content of this request was logged by a tool.Sometimes, the application made a GET request to “/refreshToken/[TOKEN_HERE]” to ask a Bearer token to Microsoft Graph API. The problem is, because the token is sent in GET, this could be present in logs and could be dangerous in case of compromising of the server, because all JWT tokens could be easily readable. Implementation: The /refreshToken endpoint is now implemented to only accept POST requests with the refresh token as the POST body fixed: #security [IMPROP02] Admin of an organization can modify the data of another admin (not in the same org) which can lead to account takeover #564 Rationale: During the audit of uat.salestim.io, SYNETIS auditors have identified a high vulnerability, allowing them to modify the data of another admin which is in another organization.Modification to such data could compromise customers and users. This vulnerability can also be used to craft a malicious payload and to create a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) stored on the victim profil configuration.When an administrator open the configuration tab in https://uat.salestim.io/forms?stEntityId=io.salestim.automation.settings, he can modify his data (Provider Id for example) and save them. Implementation: The global former /updateCustomer endpoint is deprecated and not available anymore, now replaced by three more granular endpoints /updateCatalog/updateApprovalSettings/deleteServiceAccount fixed: #security [IMPROP03] A user can impersonate another user when sending the approval email for creating a team #563 Rationale: During the audit of uat.salestim.io, SYNETIS auditors have identified a high vulnerability, allowing them to impersonate another user when a team creation need an approval step.When a user create a new team, if the template used is configured to have a team approved, an email is sent to the user with the “approval” role for the team.When user send the request, a POST request is sent to the endpoint “/v1.0/jobs/provisioning” that includes information about the requester. Implementation: on the client side (createRequestFromForm), now only the minimal information are sent (content of the form and the template ID), using this structure: { team: { name: '', description: '', welcomeMessage: '', membership: { owners: [], members: [] } }, template: { id: '' } } On the server side (/jobs/createProvisioningJob), the requester information, template information and the organization information are retreived directly from the bearer token instead of passed by the client fixed: #security [SXSS01] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) stored on 'name' and 'description' field in template creation #567 Rationale: During the audit of uat.salestim.io, SYNETIS auditors have identified a medium vulnerability, allowing them to create a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on templates by using a weakness in the field “description.This stored XSS could be dangerous because it’s reflected on all users. In case of admin account compromised, this could be impactful against the organization.When the creation of a model is saved, a POST request is sent to “/updateCustomer”. The vulnerable field is customer[formsSettings][templates][ID][templateConfiguration][description] and customer[formsSettings][templates][ID][templateConfiguration][name]When user’s try to create a new team, this will load all templates configuration and the JavaScript payload too Implementation: Direct html tag injection through our templating engine is now prevented by encoding the strings to prevent js injection from the following fields: template nametemplate descriptionteam nameteam description N.B: Code injection is still possible through naming conventions as it is the expected and the main purpose of the application fixed: #security Disable attachments in /Updateuser POST and other CosmosDB interactions #572 Rationale: The user object (and the organization object too) have an _attachment property that may permit to upload attachments. As it's not required and may be used to inject malicious files, it should be disabled.Also, in addition to _attachments, we'll also hide other system defined elements such as _rid, _ts, _self, _etag to prevent the leak of information about the underlying system.

different from the Microsoft Graph specific Open extensions and Schema extensions (that we may also support in the future if requested).Usage: Azure AD extension attributes may be located in two different locations depending on their origin: Right at the root of the user profile for attributes created by a specific application, for instance: { &quot;extension_e3049e305790413ca1b11bb53526f057_extensionAttribute10&quot;: &quot;REDACTED&quot; } These attributes are named by using the convention extension_&lt;extensions-app-id&gt;_attributename, and the &lt;extensions-app-id&gt; is specific to each tenant. To find this identifier, navigate to Azure Active Directory &gt; App registrations &gt; All applications. Search for the app that starts with &quot;aad-extensions-app&quot; and select it. On the app's Overview page, note the Application (client) ID. Usage in naming conventions and audience targeting: user.extension_e3049e305790413ca1b11bb53526f057_extensionAttribute10 In the onPremisesExtensionAttributes property of the user profile for attributes synchronized by Azure Ad Connect (Also available from the M365 Exchange Admin UI as mailbox properties), such as: { &quot;onPremisesExtensionAttributes&quot;: { &quot;extensionAttribute1&quot;: &quot;REDACTED&quot;, &quot;extensionAttribute2&quot;: &quot;REDACTED&quot;, &quot;extensionAttribute3&quot;: &quot;REDACTED&quot;, &quot;extensionAttribute4&quot;: &quot;REDACTED&quot;, &quot;extensionAttribute5&quot;: &quot;REDACTED&quot;, &quot;extensionAttribute6&quot;: null, &quot;extensionAttribute7&quot;: &quot;M&quot;, &quot;extensionAttribute8&quot;: &quot;10/03/1982&quot;, &quot;extensionAttribute9&quot;: null, &quot;extensionAttribute10&quot;: &quot;REDACTED&quot;, &quot;extensionAttribute11&quot;: null, &quot;extensionAttribute12&quot;: null, &quot;extensionAttribute13&quot;: null, &quot;extensionAttribute14&quot;: null, &quot;extensionAttribute15&quot;: null } } Usage in naming conventions and audience targeting: user.onPremisesExtensionAttributes.extensionAttribute10 To see the available extensions for a specific user, you can use this link that requests all the user profile properties: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer?request=me&amp;method=GET&amp;version=beta&amp;GraphUrl=https://graph.microsoft.com Notes for later: In order to list extensions dynamically from the UI: List apps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-listList extensions for an app: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-list-extensionproperty added: Requests Approval Workflow #approval To be applied, the following conditions have to be true (Approval is just ignored if any of these conditions are not met): Actionable message mode set to 'organization' from the settings tabA provider ID has to be setApproval has to be enabled from the templateAt least one approver has to be defined Notification email: 1 email is sent per approver The email content is personalized using the following variables: requestapprovertemplateLocale: Approval workflow uses the language specified in the template (just like provisioning notifications in a channel) The email is comprised of: The actionable cardAn HTML footer Process: Each approver receives the notification email, from which he can: Review and update the inputs from the requesterApprove the request The card is replaced by a confirmation card summarizing the approval process, including the approver and approval date Reject the request including a rejection comment The card is replaced by a confirmation card summarizing the approval process, including the approver, rejection message and its rejection message &quot;My Requests&quot; now shows 2 kinds of requests, approval and povisioning (A different icon) Process: The approval request is Created as &quot;saved&quot; à 20%move to 50% when the email are sent as &quot;approval&quot; When approved: Moves to 100% as &quot;approved&quot; (green bar) When rejected Moves to 100% as &quot;rejected&quot; (red bar)The approver name and rejection message is shown in &quot;My requests&quot; with a &quot;talk to approvers&quot; button If the approval request is approved, A new provisioning request is created at 10% as &quot;saved&quot;. Everything else on this request is similar to a request created without approval Security: Authentication: When executed from outlook (Desktop, web or mobile), the actionable card sends the current user token as part of the action transmitted to our API, ensuring that the request is authenticated Signing: Sending actionable messages relies on a principle similar to app registrations, meaning that by default it's only available in your own tenant (with a unique sender email from the tenant domain). This is the only option enabled as of today, we'll enable the generic multi-tenant option later after the Microsoft validation.Generate a new certificate and signing key: openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048 # Generate a new 2048 bits key pair using openssl openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout # Outputs the public key from the pair (the public key is the one that has to be send to MS) https://superdry.apphb.com/tools/online-rsa-key-converter # Use this online converter to convert the public key from PEM to XML (MS uses the XML format) Publish the app description + public key to the Actionable Email Developer DashboardSample: Sign the card from the server before sending it to the client: // Generate a JWS signed card payload // Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/security-requirements // Node.js sample: https://github.com/tony-zhu/SignedAdaptiveCardSample-node const cardMinified = JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(generatedCard)) // Clone the generated card as string const originator = env.vars.MAIL_ACTION_MSG_ORIGINATOR // The Actionable Message provider ID generated during provider registration const sender = job.data.cache.organization.formsSettings.msServiceAccountUpn // Set the email sender const recipients = [job.data.cache.approvers[approverId].profile.mail] // Set the email recipients (array of strings) // Combine all parameters into one payload const payload = { sender: sender, recipientsSerialized: JSON.stringify(recipients), adaptiveCardSerialized: cardMinified, originator: originator, iat: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) // Include a generation timestamp } // Sign the payload using the private key (uses the jsonwebtoken package) const cardAsJwt = jwt.sign(payload, privateSigningKey, { algorithm: 'RS256' }) // The generated JWS could be tested using the public key jwt.verify(cardAsJwt, publicSigningKey, (err, res) =&gt; { if (!err) { console.debug('jwt token OK') } else { console.debug('jwt token KO') } }) Configuration: Approval is disabled until the security configuration is done.

Resolution: The new schema is taken into account in both the naming convention and the audience targeting, server-side and client-side.All customers have been automatically upgraded to the new schema, and their configuration updated (for instance, user.msEmail is replaced by user.mail) The tech hub documentation has been updated to reflect these changes. fixed: Implement an option to fix the security issue: &quot;EJS server-side templating is vulnerable to code injection&quot; #477 Related security alert: EJS server-side templating is vulnerable to code injectionResolution: Removed all the direct server-side calls to EJS ejs.render() that may use the eval function (N.B: client-side use of ejs is safe and therefore is not impacted) in the following files: requests-processer.js: was using ejs to apply naming conventionscatalog.js: was using ejs to apply audience targeting in our api Implementation of a new sandbox.js module that encapsulates the vm2 npm package which seems the most secure fixed: Private channel name is truncated after using our new workaround #516Avoid planner throttlingchanged: Upgraded all environments to node.js v12 LTS Rationale: Better support for the enforcement of TLS v1.2 on Cosmos DB (and probably Redis too)See Announcement fixed: Naming Convention Issue in Welcome Message and Description #287 Symptom: about the request.team.name Naming convention on the welcome message and description is good at the preview level on the form but when the team is generated it's taking the whole team name and not only what the user enter in textResolution: The request object was updated by reference not by value. THe code is updated to clone values before applying any naming convention. added: Deletion of automatically generated wiki tabs During the provisioning, the process controls the number of wiki tabs in the source channel, and keeps only the same number of wiki tabs (keeping the first one in priority, that should be the original one with the right tab name) fixed: Requester and Permanent owner not added in private channel #408 Related issue: Unexpected error in postProcessRequest: {&quot;status&quot;:500,&quot;response&quot;:{&quot;req&quot;:{&quot;method&quot;:&quot;POST&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teams/1c406dc9-17bf-4ca8-b084-61e90a2d72e4/channels/19:04f7a80043744d16 (PRD) 188674Related to a microsoft Graph bug.Workaround: Implemented a retry mechanism (3 retry with a 10000ms interval) in case of error 500 in the addChannelOwner function + delays before execution of sequential tasts (such as &quot;create a PCH&quot; &gt; &quot;create a tab&quot; and &quot;install an app&quot; &gt; &quot;create a tab&quot;) changed: Planner provisioning is too long due to multiple throttled requests #515 Resolution: Created a new plannerLimiter similar to graphLimiter with specific default configuration values, especially: MICROSOFT_PLANNER_LIMITER_MAXCONCURRENT=null # No concurrency MICROSOFT_PLANNER_LIMITER_MINTIME=500 # Max 2 requests per second MICROSOFT_PLANNER_LIMITER_HIGHWATER=null # No queue limitation or leak rule changed: Rendering of templates in the catalog tab is now vastly faster, especially with a large number of templates Code optimization of rendering that was previously doing an ajax request for each template. fixed: Unknown and undocumented error in function: cloneTeamLogo.
