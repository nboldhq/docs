When throttling occurs, nBold API returns HTTP status code 429 (Too many requests), and the requests fail. Throttling limits the number of concurrent calls to a service to prevent overuse of resources. nBold API is designed to handle a high volume of requests. If an overwhelming number of requests occurs, throttling helps maintain optimal performance and reliability of the nBold API service. Throttling limits vary based on the scenario. For example, if you are performing a large volume of writes, the possibility for throttling is higher than if you are only performing reads. nBold API is conforming to the IETF ratelimit standardization proposal. üí° Note: Throttling behavior can depend on the type and number of requests. For example, if you have a high volume of requests, all requests types are throttled. Threshold limits vary based on the request type.

When you implement error handling, use the HTTP error code 429 to detect throttling. The failed response includes the Retry-After response header. Backing off requests using the Retry-After delay is the fastest way to recover from throttling because nBold API continues to log resource usage while a client is being throttled. Wait the number of seconds specified in the Retry-After header.Retry the request.If the request fails again with a 429 error code, you are still being throttled. Continue to use the recommended Retry-After delay and retry the request until it succeeds. üí° Note: If no Retry-After header is provided by the response, we recommend implementing an exponential backoff retry policy.

These best practices are gounded by the OWASP Security Design Principles: Minimize attack surface area : The aim for secure development is to reduce the overall risk by reducing the attack surface area.Establish secure defaults: By default, the experience should be secure, and it should be up to the user to reduce their security ‚Äì if they are allowed.Principle of Least privilege: The principle of least privilege recommends that accounts have the least amount of privilege required to perform their business processes. See Microsoft Graph Permissions as an example.Principle of Defense in depth: The principle of defense in depth suggests that where one control would be reasonable, more controls that approach risks in different fashions are better.Fail securely: Applications regularly fail to process transactions for many reasons. How they fail can determine if an application is secure or not.Don‚Äôt trust services: Many organizations utilize the processing capabilities of third party partners, who more than likely have differing security policies and posture than you. Therefore, implicit trust of externally run systems is not warranted. All external systems should be treated in a similar fashion.Separation of duties: Certain roles have different levels of trust than normal users. In particular, administrators are different to normal users. In general, administrators should not be users of the application.Avoid security by obscurity: Security through obscurity is a weak security control, and nearly always fails when it is the only control.Keep security simple: Developers should avoid the use of double negatives and complex architectures when a simpler approach would be faster and simpler.Fix security issues correctly: Once a security issue has been identified, it is important to develop a test for it, and to understand the root cause of the issue. When design patterns are used, it is likely that the security issue is widespread amongst all code bases, so developing the right fix without introducing regressions is essential.Secure Release Process: Aside from the Secure Development Principles, we're using several tools during our release process as a gateway before each release and deployment, to reduce risks and avoid common pitfalls.

Vendors, as well as researchers, must act responsibly. This is why we adheres to a 90-day disclosure deadline. We notify vendors of vulnerabilities immediately, with details shared in public with the defensive community after 90 days, or sooner if the vendor releases a fix. That deadline can vary in the following ways: If a deadline is due to expire on a weekend or US public holiday, the deadline will be moved to the next normal work day.Before the 90-day deadline has expired, if a vendor lets us know that a patch is scheduled for release on a specific day that will fall within 14 days following the deadline, we will delay the public disclosure until the availability of the patch.When we observe a previously unknown and unpatched vulnerability in software under active exploitation (a ‚Äú0day‚Äù), we believe that more urgent action‚Äîwithin 7 days‚Äîis appropriate. The reason for this special designation is that each day an actively exploited vulnerability remains undisclosed to the public and unpatched, more devices or accounts will be compromised. Seven days is an aggressive timeline and may be too short for some vendors to update their products, but it should be enough time to publish advice about possible mitigations, such as temporarily disabling a service, restricting access, or contacting the vendor for more information. As a result, after 7 days have elapsed without a patch or advisory, we will support researchers making details available so that users can take steps to protect themselves. As always, we reserve the right to bring deadlines forwards or backwards based on extreme circumstances. We remain committed to treating all vendors strictly equally. We expects to be held to the same standard. This policy is strongly in line with our desire to improve industry response times to security bugs, but also results in softer landings for bugs marginally over deadline. Creating pressure towards more reasonably-timed fixes will result in smaller windows of opportunity for blackhats to abuse vulnerabilities. In our opinion, vulnerability disclosure policies such as ours result in greater overall safety for users of the Internet.

Permissions","url":"/trust-center/microsoft-graph-permissions#service-account","content":"A service account is a user identity that is associated with a service executable (such as nBold) for the purpose of providing a security context for that service. Why do we NEED a service account? nBold relies intensively on the Microsoft Graph API. Therefore it's important to understand its permissions model and basic requirements. Understand delegated and application permissions Microsoft Graph has two types of permissions: Delegated permissions are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests and the app can act as the signed-in user when making calls to Microsoft Graph. Some delegated permissions can be consented by non-administrative users, but some higher-privileged permissions require administrator consent.Application permissions are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present. For example, apps that run as background services or daemons. Application permissions can only be consented by an administrator. tip Due to some Microsoft Graph functional and technical limitations, nBold now relies on a delegated permission model. In the future, nBold will switch to an application model. Learn more about Authentication and authorization basics for Microsoft Graph... How we're securing it?

Must have an active license to Microsoft Teams Why: To perform administrative operations on Microsoft Teams artefacts.

MFA adds an additional layer of protection, ensuring that service account declaration or update is done by an authorized person. Password update and MFA (Multi-factor authentication) If you enforce MFA for the service account or update its password AFTER it has been configured in nBold, you MUST update it from the &quot;Settings&quot; tab using the &quot;üé≠ Update&quot; button. Keep access limited‚Äã Ensure you only allocate AD service accounts the minimum privileges they require for the tasks they need to carry out, and don‚Äôt give them any more access than is necessary. In many cases you can remove the functionality for remote access, terminal service login, internet access, and remote control rights. Create service accounts from scratch‚Äã Don‚Äôt create service accounts in Active Directory by copying old ones, as you might accidentally be copying from a service account with much higher privileges than you need. This could lead to security issues and account misuse if you give someone an account with access to resources or information they shouldn‚Äôt be privy to. Don‚Äôt put service accounts in built-in privileged groups‚Äã Putting service accounts in groups with built-in privileges can be risky, because each person in the group will have access to the service account‚Äôs credentials. If there‚Äôs account misuse, it can be hard to figure out who the offender is. If you need a service account for a privileged group, create a new group with the same privileges and allow access only to the service account. Control password configuration‚Äã You can set a service account so the user can‚Äôt change their own password. You can also set it so the account can‚Äôt be delegated to someone else. This ensures the administrator controls the password, and nobody other than authorized users has access to the account. Enable auditing‚Äã Be sure to enable auditing for all service accounts and related objects. Once auditing is enabled, regularly check the logs to see who‚Äôs using the accounts, when, and for what purposes. Auditing is one of the most important of the best practices: it helps ensure security, verifies internal processes and compliance measures are being followed, and can discover any issues or breaches before too much time passes. You can leverage multiple sources of reports and audits: Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Teams reports: As a regular user, some aspects of the service account activity are available from the standard Microsoft 365 reports and Microsoft Teams reports. This is especially useful to monitor the overall level of activity to detect unusual patterns (external file sharing, downloads...). N.B: These reports are also available from Power BI.Microsoft 365 Defender: Detailed audit trails are accessible from the Microsoft 365 Defender portalAzure AD: From the [AAD portal)(https://aad.portal.azure.com), you have access to both signin-logs and audit logsnBold: nBold provides its own trails of all the operations performed by the service account, especially through the provisioning audit trails. These audits trails could be integrated with an SIEM solution such as Microsoft Sentinel for automated analysis and patterns recognition. Implement access rights management software‚Äã Carefully managing your Active Directory service accounts is crucial to preventing misuse of broad access and privileges. An access rights management tool can be beneficial to ensure user accounts are set up and managed with appropriate permissions and access.
