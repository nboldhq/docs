## [3.6] (2021-09-02)

- fixed: API Error Solution for "413 Request Entity Too Large" error
  - Probably the origin of this issue "Impossible to create a new template in PPR" [#897](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/897)
  - Resolution: update express middlewares by specifying a body content limit to 50mb
  ```js
  app.use(bodyParser.json({limit: '50mb'}))
  app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({limit: '50mb', extended: false}))
  ```
- changed: Better error handling in tabs configuration
  - Example:
    - Error in in graphServices/getPlannerPlan. (PRD) [#2002851](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/2002851)
    - Origin: Happens when the service account doesn't have access to the original plan
  - Error:
    - Error message: Forbidden
    - Error status: 403
    - Error response text: {"error":{"code":"","message":"You do not have the required permissions to access this item.","innerError":{"date":"2021-09-02T07:21:45","request-id":"7773f54f-5056-4214-8f84-549360adfa28","client-request-id":"7773f54f-5056-4214-8f84-549360adfa28"}}}
    - Error stack: Error: Forbidden
  - Improvements:
    - When this kind of exception happens (except for explicitely unsupported tabs such as Wiki or OneNote):
      - The audit trail mention the error with the tab and application name
      - An `organization_configuration_issue_raised` event is triggered and the issue is tracked in the corresponding table accessible from our admin portal, with this payload:
      ```json
        issue_type: 'TAB_CONFIGURATION_ISSUE',
        tenant_id: customer.msTenantId,
        tenant_initial_domain: customer.msTenantInitialDomainName,
        tenant_default_domain: customer.msTenantDefaultDomainName,
        message: `"${tabDisplayName}" (${appDisplayName}${message})`,
        status: 'open',
        diagnostic_data: JSON.stringify({
          tab_display_name: tabDisplayName,
          app_display_name: appDisplayName
        })
      ```
- fixed: Team creation getting stuck at 10% [#888](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/888)
  - Changed the behavior of requests limiters by setting the `maxConcurrent` option to `null`.
  - It appears that with a non-null value defined, some requests were leaked.
  - See: https://github.com/SGrondin/bottleneck#constructor
  - Also fixes:
    - Teams creation provisioning blocked at Planner tab [#896](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/896)
    - Impossible to create a new template in PPR [#897](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/897)

- changed: Error alerts are now temporarily sent by email in addition to as a GitHub issue in all environments for debugging purposes.
- changed: Group updates operations for email nickname and sensitivity labels are now executed through distincts functions
- changed: GitHub alerts issue creation is now managed by a request limiter to prevent beeing throttled
- refactor: Connected Apps and Governance pages optimization
  - /integration and /governance are now loaded from the main component
  - Cleaned bundled js and css
- refactor: Client instrumentation initialization code is now running asynchronously and uses the client_state object

  - Login: st-service-cicd
  - token: st-ops
  - Scope: repo
  - Has Access to the Ops repo with write access
- changed: The Connected Apps module is now managed from a dedicated repo to enable external contributors
  - See: https://github.com/nboldhq/connected-apps
- added: Admin Dashboard
  - Removed previously used AdminJs
  - Purpose: Read/Write access to the `production` environment DB (Organizations, users, options, events and audit trails...)
  - The admin dashboard is provided by the [Forest Admin](https://www.forestadmin.com/) service.
    - The admin backend is hosted from our Azure platform by the `st-admin-backend-prd` app service and published to `https://admin-backend.salestim.io` by Azure FrontDoor.
    - The service is monitored by Uptime robot as `Admin Backend` from our [Status Page](https://status.salestim.com/). It uses the `/forest/healthcheck` endpoint. See https://docs.forestadmin.com/documentation/how-tos/maintain/monitor-your-forests-status
    - See the [Admin Backend](https://github.com/nboldhq/admin-backend) README for more information.
  - The Forest Admin UI for the production environment is accessible from: [https://app.forestadmin.com/st-admin-backend/Production](https://app.forestadmin.com/st-admin-backend/Production).

  - Protected with the same authentication than the whole /admin portal
- added: Tests and documentation for the `i18n` repo
  - Initial test suite using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). See [tests](https://github.com/nboldhq/i18n/tree/master/tests).
  - Uses [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and the [iJavascript kernel](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript) as an interactive documentation. See [docs](https://github.com/nboldhq/i18n/tree/master/docs).
- changed: Private GitHub Packages
  - Our individual packages are now published in our organization [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/nboldhq/packages)
  - For instance with the `@salestim/ms-lists` repo.
    - `package.json` Incldes a `publishConfig` property that sets the access to `restricted` (to our organization) and defines GitHub Packages as the registry
      ```json
      "publishConfig": {
        "access": "restricted",
        "registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
      }
      ```
    - Could be published using `npm publish` (and the appropriate token scope)
  - From the `@salestim/app-platform` repo:
    - `.npmrc` file defines:
      - GitHub Packages as the registry for all packages from the @salestim scope through `@salestim:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com` (local packages referenced as 'file:' are not impacted)
      - The token to use to connect to GitHub Packages. To avoid to use a specific user personal access token, we're now using a new service account (that will be used for all the CI/CD operations)
        - Microsoft Azure AD Account (required because GItHub enforces SSO)
          - Name: CI/CD Service Account
          - Login: service-cicd@salestim.com
        - GitHub account:
          - Login: st-service-cicd
          - Access Token name: st-cicd (SSO must be enabled)
          - Scopes: `read:packages`
    - The `@salestim/ms-lists` package can be referenced as a dependency using `"@salestim/ms-lists": "^1.0.X"`
- changed: Remote git repo dependencies management
  - The `@nboldhq/i18n` is public, and can therefore be referenced as a dependency by:
    - `"@nboldhq/i18n": "nBold/i18n"`
    - NPM assumes that this is a public GitHub repo, therefore no protocol has to be defined
- fixed: Default values future deprecation for `express-session` middleware was generating warnings
  - Errors:
    - express-session deprecated undefined resave option; provide resave option node_modules/@adminjs/express/lib/buildAuthenticatedRouter.js:56:41
    - express-session deprecated undefined saveUninitialized option; provide saveUninitialized option node_modules/@adminjs/express/lib/buildAuthenticatedRouter.js:56:41
  - Reason:
    - From: https://github.com/expressjs/session#saveuninitialized
      - The default value is true, but using the default has been deprecated, as the default will change in the future.
    - From: https://github.com/expressjs/session#resave
      - The default value is true, but using the default has been deprecated, as the default will change in the future.
  - Fix:
    - Set values for `saveUninitialized` and `resave` in `AdminJSExpress.buildAuthenticatedRouter`
    ```js
    {
      saveUninitialized: false,
      resave: false
    }
    ```
- fixed: Default values for `express.urlencoded` middleware was generating warnings
  - Errors:
    - body-parser deprecated undefined extended: provide extended option src/app/app.js:211:21
  - Reason:
    - See: https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#express.urlencoded
  - Fix:
    - Set values for `extended` and `resave` in `app.use(express.urlencoded`
    ```js
    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }))
    ```
- added: Jupyter notebook as an interactive documentation for the `webhooks` module.
  - Uses [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and the [iJavascript kernel](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript)
  - Installation:
    ```shell
    # Install PIP Python installer
    sudo apt install pip
    # Install Jupyter notebook
    pip install notebook
    # Install nodejs prerequisites
    sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm ipython ipython-notebook
    # Install ijavascript

      - Statement (Stmts) coverage Has each statement in the program been executed?
      - Branch coverage Has each branch (also called DD-path) of each control structure (such as in if and case statements) been executed? For example, given an if statement, have both the true and false branches been executed? Another way of saying this is, has every edge in the program been executed?
      - Function (Funcs) coverage Has each function (or subroutine) in the program been called?
      - Line coverage has each executable line in the source file been executed?
- added: SonarQube analysis
  - See: https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-set-up-sonarqube-locally-on-a-react-typescript-project-ec02cd8e2626
  - SonarQube Server is run from `npm run sonar:server`.
    - See `./build/sonarqube/docker-compose.yml`
    - Hosted at: http://localhost:9000
  - SonarQube Scanner is run from `npm run sonar:scanner`. See `./build/sonarqube/sonarqube-scanner.js`
    - SonarQube Server MUST be running
- changed: Abstracted and dynamic configuration for Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Azure AD environments (National Cloud Deployments)
  - The Microsoft Graph base URL is now defined from the `MICROSOFT_GRAPH_BASEURL` environment variable (default to `https://graph.microsoft.com`)
  - The Microsoft Azure AD base URL is now defined from the `MICROSOFT_IDENTITY_PLATFORM_BASEURL` environment variable (default to `https://login.microsoftonline.com`)
- changed: Shared Channels support
  - The code is ready to enable the support of shared channels
  - This feature will be enabled when the support of shared channels will move from the /beta to /v1.0 Microsoft Graph endpoints
- changed: I18n resources now integrated as a private npm module
  - Before: json resources files were downloaded from the public repository as part of the build process using a custom code
  - Now:
    - The resources are integrated as a private npm package through a standard `npm install` (see `package.json`)
- fixed: Membership policies not reflected on the existing teams [#788](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/788)
  - fixed: Create/Update record in the teams directory table on creation
  - changed: The Governance job "Permanent membership policy" is now triggered by our scheduler (every 5 min)
  - Supported scenarios:
    - new member/owner added in a template > Added to every team attached to the template
    - deleted member/owner in team > Re-invited
    - team owner demoted to member > Re-promoted as owner
    - deleted member/owner in channel > Re-invited
    - channel owner demoted to member > Re-promoted as owner
  - added: 2 new audit trails are available in a new "Governance" tab
  - added: 2 new webhooks are available for notifications/tracking:
    - `permanent_membership_policy_team_user_invited`
    - `permanent_membership_policy_channel_user_invited`
  - changed: regular users and the service account are now using different graph permission scopes (requires a new service account sign-in)
  - Known issues:
    - For the "Permanent membership policy" to work, the service account must be signed-in again
    - The "Permanent membership policy" will only apply to new created teams (See the "Governance"\"Teams Management" tab)
- added: Run nBold platform using Docker
  - Migrated development environment from "Docker for WSL" (WSL using the docker service hosted by Windows) to a native linux docker daemon (started on boot using `service` instead of `systemd`)
  - Updated the `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide
  - Created npm scripts for building and starting each environment/role
    - Build: `npm run build:docker:[ENV]:[ROLE]`
    - Start: `npm run start:docker:[ENV]:[ROLE]`
- added: `dist.salestim.io` is now monitored by UptimeRobot as `CDN`. See [https://status.salestim.com](https://status.salestim.com)
- refactor: Externalization of key features as private NPM modules
  - Why:
    - Self-contained, better isolation
    - No more cross-dependencies (Dependencies are dynamically injected at runtime)
    - Modules dependencies are installed as node_modules by npm install
    - Individual configuration from environment variables with safe defaults
    - Each module could be externalized in its own dedicated repo later
  - New NPM modules in the `/src/modules` folder
    - Cache
    - DB
    - Events
    - GitHub
    - i18n
    - Mail
    - Sandbox
    - Webhooks
- changed: Team name now supports the "_" character. See: [#849](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/849)
- added: PPR and PRD GitHub Actions full deployment scripts
  - 2 new scipts:
    - `st-ppr-all`: Rebuild and deploy the full PPR environment from the `ppr` branch
    - `st-prd-all`: Rebuild and deploy the full PRD environment from the `production` branch
  - They are NOT triggered by a push NOR other GitHub events, but the they could be manually triggered from the GitHub Actions page:
    - https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/actions/workflows/st-ppr-all.yml
    - https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/actions/workflows/st-prd-all.yml
- changed: OWASP ZAP Baseline Scan
  - Static analysis checking. See rules: https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/
  - GitHub action updated to v0.4.0 `zaproxy/action-baseline@v0.4.0`
  - Executed evey day at 1am through GitHub Actions https://github.com/marketplace/actions/owasp-zap-baseline-scan
  - Latest scan report is available in the "OWASP Zap Baseline Scan" issue.
- added: OWASP ZAP Full Scan
  - Active pentest. See https://github.com/marketplace/actions/owasp-zap-full-scan
  - Executed evey day at 2am through GitHub Actions
  - Latest scan report is available in the "OWASP Zap Full Scan" issue.
- changed: Updated GitHub deployment actions versions
  - Node v14
  - Now NPM dependencies are cached using `actions/cache@v2`
  - Dependencies are installed from cache using `npm ci --ignore-scripts` instead of `npm install`. See https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-ci

## [3.4] (2021-07-05)

- fixed: Channels are not provisioned [#828](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/828)
  - Detected in Ops:
    - Error in /graphServices/cloningMissingChannels/createChannel. (PRD) #1757382
      ```
      StackTrace:
      at createChannel (/home/site/wwwroot/src/microsoft/graph/graphServices.js:3599:19)
      at graphLimiter.submit (/home/site/wwwroot/src/microsoft/graph/graphServices.js:6780:48)
      Payload:
      {"statusCode":400,"code":"BadRequest","message":"Invalid OData type specified: "Microsoft.Teams.Core.channel"","requestId":"1a7c87e9-483a-417f-b776-815aa90ef12c","date":"2021-07-05T15:17:10.000Z","body":"{"code":"BadRequest","message":"Invalid OData type specified: \"Microsoft.Teams.Core.channel\"","innerError":{"date":"2021-07-05T15:17:10","request-id":"1a7c87e9-483a-417f-b776-815aa90ef12c","client-request-id":"f4a45710-a1cc-4f07-c641-9df1eb683c53"}}"}
      ```
  - Root cause: Undocumented update for the v1.0 CreateChannel endpoint
    - `'@odata.type': '#Microsoft.Teams.Core.channel'` is replaced by `'@odata.type': '#Microsoft.Graph.channel'`
    - See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/channel-post?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http
- changed: Additional server protection with the Helmet package
  - A bout Helmet: https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet
  - Benefits:
    - Less security warnings in our automated pentests
    - Better control over third-party client-side modules (mostly Intercom)
    - We now have a better control over resources origins (scripts and css) and targets (Graph, Azure...) 
  - Configuration
    ```
    app.use(
      helmet({
        contentSecurityPolicy: {
          useDefaults: true,
          directives: {
            'frame-ancestors': ["'self'", 'https://teams.microsoft.com'],

          }
        }
      })
    )
    ```
- changed: /dist folder now accessible from dist.salestim.io instead of dist.salestim.io
  - Related documents have been updated on tech hub and handbook
- changed: Static assets (Images, fonts, css, compiled js...) are now distributed through GitHub Pages as a CDN
  - Static assets are now loaded from https://dist.salestim.io/clients/web
- changed: finalize dependency updates
  - All our third-party dependencies are now up to date with their respective latest version, excluding:
    - Alpine.js: migration impacts from v2 to v3 have to be evaluated
    - Bootstrap: migration impacts from v4 to v5 have to be evaluated
- fixed: Coding style / security best practices issues
  - Standard JS coding style linter: From 1600 to 8 identified issues
  - ESLint security issues: From 1866 to 10 identified issues (only from the recent connected apps modules)
- changed: https://dist.salestim.io public assets
  - About "Dist"
    - All these assets are regenerated during each commit
    - These assets are public (but theoritically not crawled by search engines)
  - Added: Third-party licenses reports.
    - https://dist.salestim.io/audits/third_party/license_summary.txt
      - Summarises the number of third-party dependencies for each license type
    - https://dist.salestim.io/audits/third_party/license_report.csv
      - Detailed report of all the third-party dependencies with their license type
  - Added: SSL Certificate report for www.salestim.com (in addition to app.salestim.io)
    - https://dist.salestim.io/audits/license_summary.txt
- changed: Dependency cleaning
  - Why: A lot of dependencies are not used anymore (mostly replaced by another one, sometimes the associated feature is not implemented anymore) 
  - Results:
    - Decreased deployment duration in integration from 8 to 3 min (1min for the entire build, 2 min to deploy to azure)
    - GitHub dependency alerts reduced from 6 to 2
  - Removed modules:

## [3.3] (2021-06-18)

- fixed: Issue with flags on template language [#814](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/814)
- fixed: Salestim display in Pl-Pl fails to default to english [#813](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/813)
- fixed: Planner Provisioning not Working in PPR [#812](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/812)
  - Updated the app installation process, but the root cause seems to be that the service account didn't had access to the app (or may it needs to open it once... to be checked)
  - Fixes this other related issue: "Planner provisioning failing with same planner added in the tab in PPR" [#815](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/815)
- fixed: Provisioning stucked at "Processing Request" [#807](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/807)
  - The provisioning engine does not rely on the standard cloning feature anymore
  - Fixed multiple 401 errors with token renewal
  - Now the service account access token is refreshed on provisioning startup
- fixed: nBold app & nBold home: BLANK [#801](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/801)
  - Analysis:
    - Looks like the issue only affects some tenants (Maybe related to waves of migrations/deployments on MS side)
    - Browser console stack trace:
      ```
      api.salestim.io/v1.0/me/roles:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden)
      main.js:3049 Error retreiving user roles.
      error @ main.js:3049
      main.js:3050 Object

      (anonymous) @ main.js:181
      ```
  - Updates:
    - Updated calls to the Microsoft Graph to retreive directory roles members using the new signature: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/directoryrole-list-members?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http
      ```
      GET /directoryRoles/roleTemplateId={role-templateId}/members
      ```
    - Side benefit, it's now done in one call instead of two.
- changed: Update to the `GenerateHookSignature` API operation and PowerPlatform action
  - The endpoint signature now only accepts a json object for the payload parameter instead of a string, in order to avoid encoding issues.
  ```yaml
  HookSignatureRequest:
      title: Hook Signature Request
      description: A HookSignatureRequest object comprised of the secret and payload.
      type: object
      properties:
        secret:
          description: Webhook secret
          type: string
        payload:
          description: Webhook payload
          type: object
      required:
        - secret
        - payload
    ```

      ```
  - Resolution:
    - The graphHelper/getTeamsDriveChildren function was using the Graph SDK. Now replaced by a 'request' operation
- changed: In-product release notes now restricted to "Change managers"
- changed: Connected Apps features visibility
  - The Connected Apps tab is only visible to users with the "Change Manager" role (OR teams service admin or global admin)
  - The Audit Trails tab is only visible to users with the "Change Manager" AND "Compliance Managers" roles (OR teams service admin or global admin)

## [3.1] (2021-05-30)

- fix: Error in approveApproval: Cannot retreive requester user (PRD) #790
  - Error message:
    ```
    at Object.logInternalServerError (/home/site/wwwroot/src/app/api/api-helper.js:32:20)
    at /home/site/wwwroot/src/app/api/routes/approvals/approvals.js:704:25
    at Object.getUser (/home/site/wwwroot/src/microsoft/db/cosmosDB/cosmosDbServices.js:44:28)
    ```
  - Root cause:
    - At line 633 of approvals.js, the function is expecting a nBold internal user ID, and receives instead an Azure AD object ID.
- added: In-product release notes
  - Implemented using the [Headway app](https://headwayapp.co/)
  - Public release notes page: https://headwayapp.co/salestim-changelog
  - Message is shown in the home navigation bar only if there are unseen updates
  - The counter uses eyecatching animations so users are nagged to click the badge
  - For testing purposes, the unseen count could be reinitialized from the Advanced menu (8 clicks on the app icon)
- added: Webhooks run history
  - A new internal event `webhook_run_executed` is triggered when a new webhook job is done
  - The webhook job is tracked in our events tables `evt_webhook_run_executed`, with the following properties:
    - Tenant ID
    - Webhook ID
    - Run ID
    - Payload
    - Start date
    - End date
    - Duration (ms)
    - Attempts
    - Status: Succeeded/Failed
    - Failed reason
  - New API operations:
    - getaudittrails, getaudittrail
      - /audittrails/:code with code = 'webhook_run_executed'
    - Accessible from the API Explorer
  - From the Integration page, we now have a new tab "Audit Trails" that shows all the audit trails for the connected apps and webhooks for the last 28 days
    - Support for I18n
    - download audit trails as excel
  - Availability: User need both `CHANGE_MANAGER` and `COMPLIANCE_MANAGER` to see this feature
- changed: Throttling headers are now included in CORS requests
  - Rationale: CORS requests have limitations and show only a subset of headers:
    - Cache-Control
    - Content-Language
    - Content-Type
    - Expires
    - Last-Modified
    - Pragma
  - Impact: This issue doesn't impact API requests made from a third-party client or server app, only web clients
  - Solution: In order to show more headers on the response, the server has to add a header to allow more extra headers.
    - The API server now systematically includes the following headers:
      - 'Access-Control-Expose-Headers': 'X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset, Retry-After'
    - Headers could be iterated from the client by:
      ```
      for (var pair of res.headers.entries()) {
        console.log(pair[0]+ ': '+ pair[1]);
      }
      ```
  - Control: Try to refresh an audit trail more than 6 times in a row to see the warning message.
- added: Advanced error diagnostic for issue: Error in graphHelper/userHasDirectoryRole/getDirectoryRoles [#787](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/787)
  - Role Template Id reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference#all-roles
  - Additional debug infos added at /home/site/wwwroot/src/microsoft/graph/graphHelper.js:1297:17
- changed: JS bundles and mins are now excluded from eslint and standard audit reports
- changed: Power Automate and Logic Apps connector labels
  - Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/openapi-extensions
  - Reviewed the following properties
    - Summary > Action title (Sentence cased)
    - x-ms-summary > Parameter + Response schema (Title Case)
    - description
    - x-ms-visibility > Operations, Parameters, Schemas
    - x-ms-trigger-hint > Operation (Sentence cased)
- Changed: Power Automate and Logic Apps connector default webhook name and description
  - Now each trigger (starting with "When...") sets its own default values for the webhook name and description
- changed: Migration to FontAwesome 5.15.3
  - Replaced the npm package "font-awesome" v4.7 to "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free" v5.15.3
- added: Service account granted permissions are now visible from the "Settings" tab
- fixed: Check if the service account is a member of a team selected as template from the catalog
  - Works again, using a new control technique
- added: The OpenAPI definition of the `/hooks` operation now describes the events and body schema of all the possible callbacks from all the supported webhooks.
  - It follows the [OpenAPI 3 Specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) for [Callbacks](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/callbacks/)
  - See it live in [API Explorer](https://developers.salestim.com/api/explorer.html#/hooks/CreateHook).
- changed: The `TeamProvisioningCompletedNotificationPayload` object (payload of the `team_provisioning_completed` [webhook](https://developers.salestim.com/api/webhooks.html#team-provisioning-completed)), now has an additional `metadata` property holding the metadata passed to the `createTeamProvisioningJob` [operation](https://developers.salestim.com/api/reference/Apis/TeamsApi.html#createteamprovisioningjob)
- changed: Metadata
  - Metadata passed through the `createTeamProvisioningJob` operation
    - The `createTeamProvisioningJob` operation accepts an arbitrary json object that could be used as a naming convention tag, or for further reference from the API
    - Input:
    ```json
    {
      "metadata": {}
    }
    ```
    - Storage
      - Metadata passed through the `createTeamProvisioningJob` are stored as a "freeform_metadata" [jsonb](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/datatype-json.html) field on the "team" table in DB
      ```json
      "freeform_metadata": {}
      ```
  - Metadata defined by a connected app
    - When an event is raised, or a job is executed, a connected app can store/update metadata and associate them with an object (team, channel or tab)
    - Storage
      - To keep the DB schema static, we're leveraging a single partitioned [jsonb](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/datatype-json.html) field in Postgresql
      - Connected apps metadata are stored as a "connectedapps_metadata" field on "team", "channel" and "tab" tables, each one partitioned in its own key:
      ```json
      "connectedapps_metadata": {
        "CONNECTEDAPP_CONFIGURATION_ID": {}
      }
      ```

      }
      ```
      - N.B: Role instance name:
        - We don't use `os.hostname` (that may change as containers are refreshed)
        - Instead, we rely on the `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME` environment variable
        - See: https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Azure-runtime-environment

  - Accessible here: https://developers.salestim.com/api/reference/
- fixed: Naming convention in inserting named and numerical character references in team name, description and welcome message
  - Example: When using "R&D" in a team name (from the UI or the API), the generated name is "R&amp;"
  - Origin: The EJS templating system escapes special characters
  - Resolution: Unescape the result of the EJS templating operation
  - Module: We're now using the [HE module](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he) (for HTML Entities) to decode named and numerical characters
- changed: Log files are not published to the ops repository anymore
- fixed: Requested members are not cleared between two requests
- fixed: Audience checkbox appears as checked even if it was previously saved as "disabled"

    - This limit is validated by combining the lengths of both the requested team name and the dynamic naming convention
  - The "|" character is now authorized
- changed: New cloned planner plans naming convention
  - Updated the function `clonePlannerTab`
  - Cloned Planner plans are now followinf the naming convention:
  ```js
  const planName = `${teamDisplayName} - ${sourcePlanDisplayName}`
  ```

  - Steps are now numbered for easier reference
- changed: Environment variables
  - As a best practice, dotenv is not loaded anymore through a `require` from the app code itself.
  - It's instead pre-loaded through the node `--require dotenv/config` command-line option:
    - In execution mode, from the `package.json` scripts: `node --require dotenv/config src/index.js`
    - In development mode, from the `launch.json` file:
      ```json
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/index.js",
      "runtimeArgs": [
        "--require",
        "dotenv/config"
      ],
      ```
  - `.env` file has been refactored and comments improved
- changed: Teams packages generation
  - The multiplicity of packages to generate, based on so many files, generated issues and made this process tedious and prone to errors.
  - Now all the packages (Standalone and Home) are automatically generated from only two template files.
  - All the variables are stored in the .env configuration file
  - Here is the up-to-date list of generated packages (we now have the home package for `int` and `uat` too), all of them still accessible from `https://dist.salestim.io/packages/[PACKAGE_FILE]`:
  ```
  io.salestim.automation.standalone.dev.zip
  io.salestim.automation.standalone.int.zip
  io.salestim.automation.standalone.ppr.zip
  io.salestim.automation.standalone.prd.zip

- changed: Migrate to the New Microsoft Graph Team Membership Management API in v1 [#624](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/624)
  - Now members are added through teams membership, instead of groups memberships
  - Add member to channel: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/channel-post-members?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http
  - Create channel: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/channel-post?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http
- fix: Prevent auto-fill on text and pickers fields
  - Problem: Under certain circumstances (when using teams from a chromium-based browser), the browser shows a list of previously selected values for forms fields
    - team name, description
    - additional members (More problematic as is masks the dropdown list of values)
  - Disabling this behavior is now enforced by using a hack to prevent the browser to use autofill on selectize fields
    - Chromium has hard-coded values to prevent autofill on password fields, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30053167/autocomplete-off-vs-false
- fix: Regression on tabs provisioning in PPR environment.
  - Root cause: the `teamsAppId` property from the tab object is deprecated from the v1.0 endpoint
  - Resolution: Instead of `tab.teamsAppId`, use `tab.teamsApp.id`
- fix: Service account owner check on templates for RBAC users displays the wrong message in PPR environment.
  - The non-tenant-admin user were not able to retreive service account id from our API, making oi appear as a non-owner.
  - Resolution: Catalog admins can now access the service account ID (as long as we're using a delegated mode with a service account)
- fix: Mandatory membership is not enforced in provisioning form in PPR environment.
  - This feature was available for standard (non-sso) authenticated users.
  - Resolution: It is now enforced for sso-connected users
- fix: Naming convention @tags (and audience targeting) are not displayed properly in PPR environment.
  - The 'tagify' component we're using introduced a new bug in their latest version when rendering non-sanitized labels
  - Resolution: Tags labels (the one visible in the dropdown) now don't use the character '>' anymore (replaced by ':')
- fix: #security updated bull-board to v1.2.0 due a a vulnerability in highlight.js. See https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7wwv-vh3v-89cq
- fixed: RBAC settings for catalog managers not applied in PPR environment.
- fixed: Naming convention tags are not properly displayed in PPR environment.
- changed: The "Compliance" tab is no hidden in PPR environment.
- fix: Placeholder label in the RBAC tab (tabs.settings.rbac.catalogManagers.placeholder) in PPR environment.
- fixed: Cannot save a new template due to an error with Summernote plugin in PPR environment.
- changed: SSO login page optimization
  - JS and CSS bundled and minified
  - Removed unnecessary js libraries
  - Intercom is only loaded in case of admin consent required
- changed: Admin consent page
  - Two buttons:
    - Consent as an administrator
    - I'm not an administrator > Talk to support
- fix: Removing the emoji in the "not admin consented" message
- added: Connected Apps server in production
- fix: Show channel by default for requesters / owners / members [#350](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-docs/issues/6792)
  - The `IsFavoriteByDefault` channel property is now officially supported by Microsoft: See [#6792](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/microsoft-graph-docs/issues/6792)
  - During the provisioning process, nBold replicate the `IsFavoriteByDefault` property value from the original channel to the cloned/created one.
- fixed: JOB RENEWSERVICEACCOUNTTOKENS: Task execution failed: Error in renewServiceAccountTokens/cosmosDbServices/updateCustomer: {"code":429,"body":"{\"code\":\"429\",\"message\":\"Message: {\\\"Errors\\\":[ (PRD) [#655](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/655)
  - This exception was causing global service interruption because this job was putting access to cosmosdb in throttled mode
  - Implemented a rate limiter for update operations (similar to the graph limiter) using the [Bottleneck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bottleneck) package
  - Job rescheduled every sunday at 6am throught cron `0 6 * * 0`
- changed: Enable Microsoft Teams App SSO for the Home package [#393](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/393)
- added: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Catalog Management [#625](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/625)
- added: Events Services (events.salestim.io)
  - Abstract:
    - Why: We're too tied to Intercom today, and Intercom lacks many ad-hoc reporting capabilities
    - Purpose: Having a self-hosted events collector, a multiplexer, a Data Warehouse and a reports server
    - Preliminary analysis: See [New events data collection platform #636](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/636)
    - Relies on [EventNative](https://github.com/jitsucom/eventnative)
  - The events service is comprised of two main workloads:
    - **Events Collector API**: A global and unified events collector API for the whole nBold application platform.
      - Examples of collected events:
        - Client-side: navigation across pages, clicks...
        - Server-side: containers start/stop, exceptions, new team provisioned, team template created...
      - The events collector API is accessible through a unique endpoint `events.salestim.io`.
    - **Events Multiplexer ETL**: An workflow that sends collected events to our DWH (Data WareHouse).
      - Our DWH relies on an Azure-managed PostgreSQL database that can be accessed through our [Reports Server](https://reports.salestim.io).
  - Infrastructure:
    - EventNative docker image `ksense/eventnative` from Docker Hub
    - Custom docker image `st-events-server`
    - ACR (Azure Container Registry) as a private docker registry: `stregistry.azurecr.io`
    - `st-events-prd` app service that hosts the API and multiplexer
    - Azure Front Door exposes the `st-events-prd` app service to `events.salestim.io`
    - Events collected from `events.salestim.io` are pushed to our DWH, an Azure-managed PostgreSQL service, exposed at `st-pgsql-prd.postgres.database.azure.com`, in the `events` database.
  - Learn more: See the [README](https://github.com/nboldhq/st-events-server#readme) file from the [Events Server](https://github.com/nboldhq/st-events-server) repository.
- added: Reports Server (reports.salestim.io)
  - Abstract:
    - A self-service report server that may query multiple data source, especially our DWH
    - Relies on [Redash](https://redash.io/)
    - Accessible from [reports.salestim.io](https://reports.salestim.io)
  - Infrastructure:
    - The Redash instance uses the [Bitnami Redash image](https://bitnami.com/stack/redash/cloud) and hosts:
      - Redash server roles
      - An embedded Redis instance
      - An embedded PostgreSQL instance
    - The Azure VM is `st-reports-prd`
- added: Mandatory Owners & Members (Security Policy) [#623](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/623)
- changed: Pre-production Home Package
  - A new home package for the pre-production environment is now accessible here: https://dist.salestim.io/packages/io.salestim.automation.targeted.home.ppr.zip
- fixed: Mobile Icon format issue [#642](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/642)
  - Fixed by updating the `accentColor` property from manifests files from `#a60a2d` to `#000000`
- fixed: #security Dependency Alert: build(deps): bump find-my-way from 2.2.3 to 2.2.5 [#627](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/pull/627)
- changed: Status monitoring
  - Services status is now monitored by both UptimeRobot and Azure Front Door
  - Alerts are now sent to:
    - monitoring.alerts@salestim.com (Guillaume and Alex)
    - Teams DevOps\Ops channel
  - Uptime Robot configuration:
    - Websites are monitored as usual (basic HTTP GET probe every 5 min):
      - Help Center
      - Tech Hub
      - Website
    - App Services: Use the HTTP method HEAD on `/monitoring/ping` on port 443. **The only accepted UP status code is 200**.
      - PPR health probe frequency: 15 min
      - PRD health probe frequency: 1 min
  - Azure Front Door configuration:
    - See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-health-probes
    - Monitors all instances from the PPR and PRD backend pools
      - Use the HTTP method HEAD on `/monitoring/ping` on port 443. **The only accepted UP status code is 200**.
      - ***Since Front Door has many edge environments globally, health probe volume for your backends can be quite high - ranging from 25 requests every minute to as high as 1200 requests per minute, depending on the health probe frequency configured. With the default probe frequency of 30 seconds, the probe volume on your backend should be about 200 requests per minute.***
      - PPR health probe frequency: 255 seconds (higher possible value)
      - PRD health probe frequency: 30 seconds
- fixed: An unhandledRejection has been detected. (PRD) [#607](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/607)
  - Impact: In some circumstances, the provisioning service may shutdown unexpectedly if the cloning operation raises an unknown error
  - Resolution: Better processing of the error raised by Microsoft Graph
- fixed: [Provisionning Issue] - Impossible to create a team [#604](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/604)
  - related ops issue: Error cloning missing tabs in /graphServices/cloneTabsSettingsAndContents/cloningMissingChannelsAndTabs. (PRD) [#357899](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/357899)
  - Impacted code: GraphServices.js line 3100
    ```js
    // Depending on App Id
    switch (localSourceTab.teamsAppId.toLowerCase()) {
    ```
  - Root cause: the `teamsAppId` property from the tab object is deprecated from the beta endpoint
  - Resolution: Instead of `tab.teamsAppId`, use `tab.teamsApp.id`
    ```json
    {
      "id":"07ebdc9b-8419-4f64-9cb4-1ab3c8ca96c3",
      "displayName":"testPA",
      "teamsAppId":null,

        "displayName":"Power Apps",
        "distributionMethod":"store"
        }
      }
    ```
- fixed: End-users are not able to see templates [#594](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/594)
  - Implementation
    - app.js:
      - Updated bodyParser json and urlencoded to a limitof '200mb'
    - api.js:
      - Disabled the helmet protection module
      - Disabled the express-rate-limit module
    - mainForms.js
      - Replaced native fetch calls with their JQuery counterparts
  - Resources:

    - Fetch behavior: https://javascript.info/fetch-crossorigin
- fixed: Issue in templates Title in catalog [#584](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/584)
  - Removed 'UrlEncoding' in display
- changed: Support for the German language, both inside the product and for the manifests
  - Supported language / countries:
    ```javascript
    'de-at' // Austria
    'de-ch' // Switzerland 
    'de-de' // Germany
    'de-li' // Liechtenstein
    'de-lu' // Luxembourg
    ```
- changed: Teams packages generation
  - Now during the build, teams manifests are generated using a template that inserts localized strings from our internationalization repo.
  - Purpose, avoid future errors and make our localization process more simple
  - Related issue [#585](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/585)
- fixed: Build process is never ending, generating deployment errors
  - Origin: Due to the new use of i18n server in the build process to dynamically insert locales variables to the teams manifests files, the default dev mode was using an "auto-reload" mode that prevented the build process to stop as it cas constantly listening for changes. 
  - fix: Disable the live-reload mode of the i18n module even in dev mode
- fixed: #security [INFODISC01] Verbosity errors leaks internal infrastructure information [#566](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/566)
  - Rationale:
    - During the audit of uat.salestim.io, SYNETIS auditors have identified a medium vulnerability, allowing them to disclose some internal information about “CosmoDB” and more.
    - When a POST request is made to the endpoint “/updateUser” if a value of a field is incorrectly set, the server return an error in JSON. Instead of a simple message, the error display lot of interesting information regarding the infrastructure of CosmoDB and the Azure Storage. This could be useful to perform another attack like SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).
    - Example of POST request sent to the server with a bad value in “user%5Bid%5D=”:
  - Implementation:
    - Returned errors from CosmosDB are not returned anymore, replaced by custom one
- fixed: #security [INFODISC02] The endpoint “/refreshToken” send a JWT token in GET [#565](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/565)
  - Rationale:
    - During the audit of uat.salestim.io, SYNETIS auditors have identified a medium vulnerability, which could be dangerous if the request was intercepted or if the content of this request was logged by a tool.
    - Sometimes, the application made a GET request to “/refreshToken/[TOKEN_HERE]” to ask a Bearer token to Microsoft Graph API. The problem is, because the token is sent in GET, this could be present in logs and could be dangerous in case of compromising of the server, because all JWT tokens could be easily readable.
  - Implementation:
    - The /refreshToken endpoint is now implemented to only accept POST requests with the refresh token as the POST body
- fixed: #security [IMPROP02] Admin of an organization can modify the data of another admin (not in the same org) which can lead to account takeover [#564](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/564)
  - Rationale:
    - During the audit of uat.salestim.io, SYNETIS auditors have identified a high vulnerability, allowing them to modify the data of another admin which is in another organization.
    - Modification to such data could compromise customers and users. This vulnerability can also be used to craft a malicious payload and to create a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) stored on the victim profil configuration.
    - When an administrator open the configuration tab in https://uat.salestim.io/forms?stEntityId=io.salestim.automation.settings, he can modify his data (Provider Id for example) and save them.
  - Implementation: The global former /updateCustomer endpoint is deprecated and not available anymore, now replaced by three more granular endpoints
    - /updateCatalog
    - /updateApprovalSettings
    - /deleteServiceAccount
- fixed: #security [IMPROP03] A user can impersonate another user when sending the approval email for creating a team [#563](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/563)
  - Rationale:
    - During the audit of uat.salestim.io, SYNETIS auditors have identified a high vulnerability, allowing them to impersonate another user when a team creation need an approval step.
    - When a user create a new team, if the template used is configured to have a team approved, an email is sent to the user with the “approval” role for the team.
    - When user send the request, a POST request is sent to the endpoint “/v1.0/jobs/provisioning” that includes information about the requester.
  - Implementation:
    - on the client side (createRequestFromForm), now only the minimal information are sent (content of the form and the template ID), using this structure:
      ```json
      {
        team: {
          name: '',
          description: '',
          welcomeMessage: '',
          membership: {
            owners: [],
            members: []
          }
        },
        template: {
          id: ''
        }
      }
      ```
    - On the server side (/jobs/createProvisioningJob), the requester information, template information and the organization information are retreived directly from the bearer token instead of passed by the client
- fixed: #security [SXSS01] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) stored on 'name' and 'description' field in template creation [#567](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/567)
  - Rationale:
    - During the audit of uat.salestim.io, SYNETIS auditors have identified a medium vulnerability, allowing them to create a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on templates by using a weakness in the field “description.
    - This stored XSS could be dangerous because it’s reflected on all users. In case of admin account compromised, this could be impactful against the organization.
    - When the creation of a model is saved, a POST request is sent to “/updateCustomer”. The vulnerable field is `customer[formsSettings][templates][ID][templateConfiguration][description]` and `customer[formsSettings][templates][ID][templateConfiguration][name]`
    - When user’s try to create a new team, this will load all templates configuration and the JavaScript payload too
  - Implementation: Direct html tag injection through our templating engine is now prevented by encoding the strings to prevent js injection from the following fields:
    - template name
    - template description
    - team name
    - team description
  - N.B: Code injection is still possible through naming conventions as it is the expected and the main purpose of the application
- fixed: #security Disable attachments in /Updateuser POST and other CosmosDB interactions [#572](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/572)
  - Rationale:
    - The user object (and the organization object too) have an `_attachment` property that may permit to upload attachments. As it's not required and may be used to inject malicious files, it should be disabled.
    - Also, in addition to _attachments, we'll also hide other system defined elements such as `_rid`, `_ts`, `_self`, `_etag` to prevent the leak of information about the underlying system.
  - Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cosmos-db/documents
  - Implementation:
    - Hide these fields in the corresponding 'get' functions to prevent them from beeing visible from the client:
      - /getUser
      - /getCustomer
      - /getCustomer/:tenantId
    - Remove these fields from the corresponding 'update' functions before updating cosmosdb
      - /updateUser
      - /updateCustomer

## [2.1.0] Codename "Hakuho" - (2020-09-03)

- fixed: Approval not working in PPR (issue not identified) [#569](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/569)
  - `/locales/i18nServer.js` was not initialized in `api` role (as opposed to the standalone role)
- fixed: Error 404 in function: getUserPhoto with arguments [#558](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/558)
  - Happens when the requester has no profile picture.
    - Handle empty user photo properly (404 error in graphServices, returning a null response)
    - Use a generic avatar picture instead: https://uat.salestim.io/img/avatar-neutral-blue.png
- fixed: Invalid token when pushing alerts to the GitHub "ops" repository.
  - Update to the private token (code "SalesTimOpsAlerts") used to coneect to the ops repository to support the SSO authentication
    - Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on
- fixed: Error when saving approval settings when no template is present [#551](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/551)
  - Original Ops issue: An unhandledRejection has been detected. (UAT) [#240102](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/240102)
- added: New UI to use tags in naming conventions and audience targeting
  - While editing a naming convention (Name, description, email, welcome message) in a template, the user can select pre-made tags by typing either "@" or "#", then selecting the tag from the list.
  - Tags could be mixed with static content
  - Tags could coexist with dynamic contents (meaning other <% %> elements typed directly in the textbox)
  - Relies on the [Tagify](https://github.com/yairEO/tagify) component
  - Available tags:
    - Naming conventions:
      ```yaml
      { id: 1100, value: '<%= request.team.name %>', title: i18n.__('tags.request.team.name'), bgColor: requestTagsBgColor, textColor: requestTagsTextColor },
      { id: 1101, value: '<%= request.team.description %>', title: i18n.__('tags.request.team.description'), bgColor: requestTagsBgColor, textColor: requestTagsTextColor },
      { id: 1102, value: '<%= request.team.welcomeMessage %>', title: i18n.__('tags.request.team.welcomeMessage'), bgColor: requestTagsBgColor, textColor: requestTagsTextColor },
      { id: 1103, value: '<%= request.template.name %>', title: i18n.__('tags.request.template.name'), bgColor: requestTagsBgColor, textColor: requestTagsTextColor },
      { id: 1200, value: '<%= user.id %>', title: i18n.__('tags.user.profile.id'), bgColor: userTagsBgColor, textColor: userTagsTextColor },
      { id: 1201, value: '<%= user.city %>', title: i18n.__('tags.user.profile.city'), bgColor: userTagsBgColor, textColor: userTagsTextColor },
      { id: 1202, value: '<%= user.companyName %>', title: i18n.__('tags.user.profile.companyName'), bgColor: userTagsBgColor, textColor: userTagsTextColor },
      { id: 1203, value: '<%= user.country %>', title: i18n.__('tags.user.profile.country'), bgColor: userTagsBgColor, textColor: userTagsTextColor },
      { id: 1204, value: '<%= user.department %>', title: i18n.__('tags.user.profile.department'), bgColor: userTagsBgColor, textColor: userTagsTextColor },
      { id: 1205, value: '<%= user.displayName %>', title: i18n.__('tags.user.profile.displayName'), bgColor: userTagsBgColor, textColor: userTagsTextColor },
      { id: 1206, value: '<%= user.employeeId %>', title: i18n.__('tags.user.profile.employeeId'), bgColor: userTagsBgColor, textColor: userTagsTextColor },
      { id: 1207, value: '<%= user.givenName %>', title: i18n.__('tags.user.profile.givenName'), bgColor: userTagsBgColor, textColor: userTagsTextColor },

- added: Support for Azure Active Directory schema extensions (aka custom attributes) in #naming-conventions and #audience-targeting
  - WARNING: The Azure AD `schema extensions` are different from the Microsoft Graph specific `Open extensions` and `Schema extensions` (that we may also support in the future if requested).
  - Usage: Azure AD extension attributes may be located in two different locations depending on their origin:
    1. Right at the root of the user profile for attributes created by a specific application, for instance:
    ```yaml
    { "extension_e3049e305790413ca1b11bb53526f057_extensionAttribute10": "REDACTED" }
    ```
    These attributes are named by using the convention `extension_<extensions-app-id>_attributename`, and the `<extensions-app-id>` is specific to each tenant. To find this identifier, navigate to [Azure Active Directory > App registrations > All applications](https://aad.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/AllApps/menuId/). Search for the app that starts with "aad-extensions-app" and select it. On the app's Overview page, note the Application (client) ID.
    Usage in naming conventions and audience targeting:
    ```js
    user.extension_e3049e305790413ca1b11bb53526f057_extensionAttribute10
    ```
    1. In the `onPremisesExtensionAttributes` property of the user profile for attributes synchronized by Azure Ad Connect (Also available from the M365 Exchange Admin UI as mailbox properties), such as:
    ```yaml
    { 
      "onPremisesExtensionAttributes": {
        "extensionAttribute1": "REDACTED",
        "extensionAttribute2": "REDACTED",
        "extensionAttribute3": "REDACTED",
        "extensionAttribute4": "REDACTED",
        "extensionAttribute5": "REDACTED",
        "extensionAttribute6": null,
        "extensionAttribute7": "M",
        "extensionAttribute8": "10/03/1982",
        "extensionAttribute9": null,
        "extensionAttribute10": "REDACTED",
        "extensionAttribute11": null,
        "extensionAttribute12": null,
        "extensionAttribute13": null,
        "extensionAttribute14": null,
        "extensionAttribute15": null
      }
    }
    ```
    Usage in naming conventions and audience targeting:
    ```js
    user.onPremisesExtensionAttributes.extensionAttribute10
    ```
  - To see the available extensions for a specific user, you can use this link that requests all the user profile properties:
    - https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer?request=me&method=GET&version=beta&GraphUrl=https://graph.microsoft.com
  - Notes for later:
    - In order to list extensions dynamically from the UI:
      - List apps: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-list
      - List extensions for an app: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-list-extensionproperty
- added: Requests Approval Workflow #approval
  - To be applied, the following conditions have to be true (Approval is just ignored if any of these conditions are not met):
    - Actionable message mode set to 'organization' from the settings tab
    - A provider ID has to be set
    - Approval has to be enabled from the template
    - At least one approver has to be defined
  - Notification email: 1 email is sent per approver
    - The email content is personalized using the following variables:
      - request
      - approver
      - template
      - Locale: Approval workflow uses the language specified in the template (just like provisioning notifications in a channel)
    - The email is comprised of:
      - The actionable card
      - An HTML footer
    - Process:
      - Each approver receives the notification email, from which he can:
        - Review and update the inputs from the requester
        - Approve the request
          - The card is replaced by a confirmation card summarizing the approval process, including the approver and approval date
        - Reject the request including a rejection comment
          - The card is replaced by a confirmation card summarizing the approval process, including the approver, rejection message and its rejection message
  - "My Requests" now shows 2 kinds of requests, approval and povisioning (A different icon)
    - Process:
      - The approval request is Created as "saved" à 20%
      - move to 50% when the email are sent as "approval"
        - When approved:
          - Moves to 100% as "approved" (green bar)
        - When rejected
          - Moves to 100% as "rejected" (red bar)
          - The approver name and rejection message is shown in "My requests" with a "talk to approvers" button
      - If the approval request is approved, A new provisioning request is created at 10% as "saved". Everything else on this request is similar to a request created without approval
  - Security:
    - Authentication:
      - When executed from outlook (Desktop, web or mobile), the actionable card sends the current user token as part of the action transmitted to our API, ensuring that the request is authenticated
    - Signing:
      - Sending actionable messages relies on a principle similar to app registrations, meaning that by default it's only available in your own tenant (with a unique sender email from the tenant domain). This is the only option enabled as of today, we'll enable the generic multi-tenant option later after the Microsoft validation.
      - Generate a new certificate and signing key:
        ```sh
        openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048 # Generate a new 2048 bits key pair using openssl
        openssl rsa -in private.pem -out public.pem -outform PEM -pubout # Outputs the public key from the pair (the public key is the one that has to be send to MS)
        https://superdry.apphb.com/tools/online-rsa-key-converter # Use this online converter to convert the public key from PEM to XML (MS uses the XML format)
        ```
      - Publish the app description + public key to the [Actionable Email Developer Dashboard](https://aka.ms/publishoam)
      - Sample: Sign the card from the server before sending it to the client:
        ```js
        // Generate a JWS signed card payload
        // Reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/security-requirements
        // Node.js sample: https://github.com/tony-zhu/SignedAdaptiveCardSample-node
        const cardMinified = JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(generatedCard)) // Clone the generated card as string
        const originator = env.vars.MAIL_ACTION_MSG_ORIGINATOR // The Actionable Message provider ID generated during provider registration
        const sender = job.data.cache.organization.formsSettings.msServiceAccountUpn // Set the email sender
        const recipients = [job.data.cache.approvers[approverId].profile.mail] // Set the email recipients (array of strings)
        // Combine all parameters into one payload
        const payload = {
          sender: sender,
          recipientsSerialized: JSON.stringify(recipients),
          adaptiveCardSerialized: cardMinified,
          originator: originator,
          iat: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) // Include a generation timestamp
        }
        // Sign the payload using the private key (uses the jsonwebtoken package)
        const cardAsJwt = jwt.sign(payload, privateSigningKey, { algorithm: 'RS256' })
        // The generated JWS could be tested using the public key
        jwt.verify(cardAsJwt, publicSigningKey, (err, res) => {
          if (!err) {
            console.debug('jwt token OK')
          } else {
            console.debug('jwt token KO')
          }
        })
        ```
    - Configuration:
      - Approval is disabled until the security configuration is done. In the meantime, a warning message is shown in the template UI.
      - Published configuration procedure: https://developers.salestim.com/nocode/approval.html
- fixed: graphServices/createTeamFromTemplate/sendMessage error. (PRD) [#540](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/540)
  - added a control to check if a message to send is not empty
  - added: control to replace some characters with their html code counterpart:
    - `.replace(/'/gim, '&apos;')`
    - `.replace(/[\r\n]/gim, '<br/>')`
- added: New security report available online about our SSL certificates
  - Accessible from: https://dist.salestim.io/audits/certificates_report.log
- added: Daily security scan using [OWASP ZAP scan](https://www.zaproxy.org/blog/2020-04-09-automate-security-testing-with-zap-and-github-actions/)
  - This scan is performed every day at 1am and generates a detailed report as a new issue in the main repository (see [#538](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/538) as an example)
- changed: checked compatibility of our Redis client with TLS 1.2 that will be enforced by Microsoft soon
- fixed: Requester not added in private channels [#528](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/528)
  - We were using the requester ID from the request object which is nBold ID. Now, instead, we use the msUserId (from AD) from the user object.
- fixed: Error 404 in function: addChannelOwner [#192827](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/192827)
  - Manage 404 error in case of bad provisioning
- changed: Updated manifests to v1.7, including the following properties:
  - `showLoadingIndicator`: `false` (always `false` as it seems to break the app)
  - `isFullScreen`: `false` for standalone packages, `true` for targeted packages
- changed: Handbook is now restricted to "Members" (aka employees) from the nBold tenant
- changed: Documentation about naming convention and audience targeting tags
  - The tech hub documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.
- fixed: Audience targeting issue
  - Cause:
    - Related to how the api returns the user profile (and the necessary work to handle profile custom attributes)
  - Consequences:
    - The user profile used for the audience targeting and the naming conventions is now entirely based on the strict Graph API definition, and therefore changes all our naming conventions and audience targeting rules, especially the tags we can use.
  - Resolution:
    - The new schema is taken into account in both the naming convention and the audience targeting, server-side and client-side.
    - All customers have been automatically upgraded to the new schema, and their configuration updated (for instance, `user.msEmail` is replaced by `user.mail`)
  - The tech hub documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.
- fixed: Implement an option to fix the security issue: "EJS server-side templating is vulnerable to code injection" [#477](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/477)
  - Related security alert: [EJS server-side templating is vulnerable to code injection](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-jq59-4wc7-p87x)
  - Resolution:
    - Removed all the direct server-side calls to EJS `ejs.render()` that may use the `eval` function (N.B: client-side use of ejs is safe and therefore is not impacted) in the following files:
      - `requests-processer.js`: was using ejs to apply naming conventions
      - `catalog.js`: was using ejs to apply audience targeting in our api
    - Implementation of a new `sandbox.js` module that encapsulates the [vm2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vm2) npm package which seems the most secure
- fixed: Private channel name is truncated after using our new workaround [#516](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/516)
Avoid planner throttling
- changed: Upgraded all environments to node.js v12 LTS
  - Rationale: Better support for the enforcement of TLS v1.2 on Cosmos DB (and probably Redis too)
  - See [Announcement](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.13.0/)
- fixed: Naming Convention Issue in Welcome Message and Description [#287](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/287)
  - Symptom: about the request.team.name Naming convention on the welcome message and description is good at the preview level on the form but when the team is generated it's taking the whole team name and not only what the user enter in text
  - Resolution: The request object was updated by reference not by value. THe code is updated to clone values before applying any naming convention.
- added: Deletion of automatically generated wiki tabs
  - During the provisioning, the process controls the number of wiki tabs in the source channel, and keeps only the same number of wiki tabs (keeping the first one in priority, that should be the original one with the right tab name)
- fixed: Requester and Permanent owner not added in private channel [#408](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/408)
  - Related issue: Unexpected error in postProcessRequest: {"status":500,"response":{"req":{"method":"POST","url":"https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teams/1c406dc9-17bf-4ca8-b084-61e90a2d72e4/channels/19:04f7a80043744d16 (PRD) [188674](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/188674)
  - Related to a microsoft Graph bug.
  - Workaround: Implemented a retry mechanism (3 retry with a 10000ms interval) in case of error `500` in the `addChannelOwner` function + delays before execution of sequential tasts (such as "create a PCH" > "create a tab" and "install an app" > "create a tab")
- changed: Planner provisioning is too long due to multiple throttled requests [#515](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/515)
  - Resolution: Created a new `plannerLimiter` similar to `graphLimiter` with specific default configuration values, especially:
    ```sh
    MICROSOFT_PLANNER_LIMITER_MAXCONCURRENT=null # No concurrency
    MICROSOFT_PLANNER_LIMITER_MINTIME=500     # Max 2 requests per second
    MICROSOFT_PLANNER_LIMITER_HIGHWATER=null  # No queue limitation or leak rule
    ```
- changed: Rendering of templates in the catalog tab is now vastly faster, especially with a large number of templates
  - Code optimization of rendering that was previously doing an ajax request for each template.
- fixed: Unknown and undocumented error in function: cloneTeamLogo. (PPR) [#188236](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/188236)
  - Cause: Locale files were not loaded as the `jobs` role was not loading the webapp.
  - Resolution: The `workersLauncher.js` service is now requiring `i18nServer.js` so that it's loaded systematically
- fixed: Unable to save template in PPR
  - Cause: Misconfigured blob container for PPR in `stsaprd` storage account
  - Related issue: Unexpected error in /blobServices/savePicture/createBlockBlobFromStream. (PPR) [#188030](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/188030)
- security: bump standard-version from 7.1.0 to 8.0.1 [#505](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/pull/505)
- added: PPR dedicated app, api and jobs roles
  - PPR is now hosted with an architecture similar to PRD, with dedicated instances for each role
  - Now dynamically assigning the right service URL based on environment:
    - `WEB_PUBLICURL_PRD`
    - `API_PUBLICURL_PRD`
    - `JOB_PUBLICURL_PRD`
- security: bump jquery from 3.4.1 to 3.5.0 [#460](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/pull/460)
  - Related issue:
    - Audit Button in My Request - not working [#452](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/452)
    - Cause: Incompatibility between bootstrap v4.4.1 and jquery v3.5.0 > Downgraded jquery to v3.4.1. See [Bootstrap Issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/30553)
    - Resolution: Upgraded JQuery to 3.5.1 to avoid conflicts with bootstrap
- fixed: Infinite retry loop when trying to clone a team where the service account is not an owner
  - Resolution:
    - In case of error "403_FORBIDDEN", the provisioning process tries to add the service account as an owner of the source team
    - The pre-processing entries (everything before the actual team cloning) in the audit trail will therefore be visible twice, indicating that the provisioning process has been restarted.
- fixed: Infinite retry loop when adding the requester as an owner of a private channel.
  - Cause: The graph is supposed to return a 400 error in case of duplicate (trying to add a user when he's already a member), but sometimes returns a 500 error...
  - Resolution: Just skipping outside the addChannelOwner method when error 500 is reached.
- fixed: In audit trail, the private channels requested owners and permanent owners names are "undefined"
  - Now retreiving the user displayName during provisioning
- fixed: In audit trail, the private channels names are not displayed
  - Now retreiving the channel displayName during provisioning (instead of the "name" property)
- fixed: Planner plan cloning takes a large amount of time and may fail as it gets throttled while exporting the original plan
  - Refactored the `exportPlannerPlanAsJson` and `provisionPlannerContent` functions to use the graphLimiter to schedule calls to the Graph
- fixed: infinite retry loop in copyDriveItem
  - Cause: In case of channels that have been renamed, the drive copy process fails and loops on retry for error 500 (as the original folder could not be found)
  - Resolution: Changed the retry mechanism to limit the number of retry to 3 in any case
- Added: Provisioning retry on fail
  - In case of major crash (the main process is stopped and automatically restarted), if a request has still not yes created the new team, the newly started process restarts the provisioning process using the same request.
  - The pre-processing entries (everything before the actual team cloning) in the audit trail will therefore be visible twice, indicating that the provisioning process has been restarted.
- fixed: In some cases, the provisioning process was stopped after configuring tabs:
  - Cause: multiple wiki tabs with the same name (such as wiki tabs automatically added by the standard cloning process) were generating confusion in our code, preventing the tabs configuration to end properly
  - Resolution: better error management in the tabs configuration process
- changed: Tabs types that doesn't support configuration (Wiki, PowerBI, OneNote) are now visible in the audit trail with a descriptive message
- fixed: Unsupported tabs names in the audit trails are now "URL-decoded", preventing weird codes to be visible such as `%20`, 
- fixed: graphServices/createTeamFromTemplate/sendMessage error. (INT) [#174802](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/174802)
  - Added a token refresh handler in case of expiration during a provisioning process
- fixed: Redis connectivity issue in UAT
  - Related issues:
    - Alert job error (UAT) [#174317](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/174317): Error initializing Lua scripts
    - Job Logging job error (UAT) [#174234](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/174234): connect ETIMEDOUT
    - An unhandledRejection has been detected. (UAT) [#174236](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/174236): connect ETIMEDOUT
  - Resources: See "Connection time out during queue add" [#1366](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/issues/1366#issuecomment-506734828)
  - Fix: Increase the ioredis connectTimeout property to 30000 (ms) so that queues have time to connect during startup
- fixed: Unknown and undocumented error in function: getMyRequestsCount. (INT) [#174131](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/174131)
  - Better error management in case of network latency issues
- changed: jobs queues are now prefixed with the current environment for better isolation
- fixed: An unhandledRejection has been detected. (UAT) [#172834](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/172834)
  - The service is now restarted if an unhandledRejection is detected, for instance a Redis connectivity issue during boot.
- changed: better log levels management with distinction between verbose and debug
  - Now using the `npm` logging levels prioritized from 0 to 6 (highest to lowest):
    ```yaml
    { 
      error: 0, 
      warn: 1, 
      info: 2, 
      http: 3,
      verbose: 4, 
      debug: 5, 
      silly: 6 
    }
    ```

  - Supported tabs: Tab cloning and configuration works and is officially supported by nBold (SUPPORTED by Microsoft)
    - Custom tabs
    - Website tabs
    - Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF tabs
    - Document library tabs
    - YouTube tabs
    - Yammer tabs
  - Unsupported tabs: Tab cloning and configuration SHOULD work but cannot be officially supported by nBold (UNSUPPORTED by Microsoft)
    - Planner tabs
    - Microsoft Stream tabs
    - Microsoft Forms tabs
    - SharePoint page and list tabs
  - Ignored: Tab cloning without configuration
    - Power BI tabs
    - Wiki tabs
    - OneNote tabs
- fixed: #provisioning 1 Private Channel Missing - Systra [#480](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/480)
  - Symptom: Sometimes, the Graph accepts to create a channel (and returns an ID), but then the channel is not visible anymore from the graph.
  - See "Error in graphHelper/updateTabConfiguration" [#169114](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/169114)
    ```yaml
    {
      "statusCode":404,
      "code":"NotFound",
      "message":"No active channel found with channel id: 19:2110ddd4c6ab4906a0cec78bf6d13459@thread.tacv2",
      "requestId":"a6f8d51f-dc50-45a6-8a48-414e199924e8",
      "date":"2020-07-02T05:47:54.000Z"
    }
    ```
  - IMPORTANT: THIS IS NOT A REAL FIX, JUST A WORKAROUND
    - Basically, after the creation of a private channel:
      - Wait for 10sec
      - Check if the /tabs endpoint for this channel is responding (returns a 404 in case of error)
      - If the /tabs returns an error:
        - Delete the channel
        - Restart the private channel provisioning process (every 10 sec, max 3 times), using a different name:
          - Adding " (1)", " (2)" or " (3)" respectively for retry #1, #2 and #3
        - Retest the /tabs endpoint
- fixed: #provisioning Missing Tabs [481](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/481)
- fixed: #provisioning 3 tabs missing in the provisionning [#482](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/482)
- fixed: #ui My requests not working correctly [#484](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/484)
  - Happened when the requests list was empty due to a bug in the /me/jobs api
- fixed: #provisioning Tabs provisioned in the wrong channel
  - Fixed by reordering (alphabetically on the displayName) channels after the full provisioning, as they may have been created in a different order.
- fixed: #provisioning Apps not cloned in private channels
  - Error undefined in function: createTab with arguments: [#165395](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/165395)
  - Resolution: Implement a control process that install missing apps automatically during the provisioning
- fixed: #login Unable to login in dev mode when using wsl
  - Cause: WSL internal clock stops synchronizing with the host, resulting in a JWT check error.
  - Fix: none so far. See [system date is not same with windows (WSL 2) #4245](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4245)
  - Workaround: Execute the following command to force sync `sudo hwclock -s`

## [2.0.0] Codename "Kisenosato" - (2020-06-18)

  - Updated the cloningMissingChannels function to take into account the asynchronous private channels creation
- fixed: Planner tab plans are not provisioned [#462](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/462)
  - Planner tabs configuration is now temporarly not supported anymore. See [Configuring the built-in tab types in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-configuring-builtin-tabs#planner-tabs)
  - After a retro-engineering phase, here is the new formats for the 3 main tab configuration properties:
  ```js
  const tabVersion = '&tabVersion=20200228.1_s' // Temporarly added, to be checked regularly
  const targetContentUrl = `https://tasks.teams.microsoft.com/teamsui/{tid}/Home/PlannerFrame?page=7&auth_pvr=OrgId&auth_upn={userPrincipalName}&groupId={groupId}&planId=${targetPlannerPlan.id}&channelId={channelId}&entityId={entityId}&tid={tid}&userObjectId={userObjectId}&subEntityId={subEntityId}&sessionId={sessionId}&theme={theme}&mkt={locale}&ringId={ringId}&PlannerRouteHint={tid}${tabVersion}`
  const targetWebsiteUrl = `https://tasks.office.com/${tenantId}/Home/PlanViews/${targetPlannerPlan.id}?Type=PlanLink&Channel=TeamsTab`
  const targetRemoveUrl = `https://tasks.teams.microsoft.com/teamsui/{tid}/Home/PlannerFrame?page=13&auth_pvr=OrgId&auth_upn={userPrincipalName}&groupId={groupId}&planId=${targetPlannerPlan.id}&channelId={channelId}&entityId={entityId}&tid={tid}&userObjectId={userObjectId}&subEntityId={subEntityId}&sessionId={sessionId}&theme={theme}&mkt={locale}&ringId={ringId}&PlannerRouteHint={tid}${tabVersion}`
  ```
  - In addition, the plan id is not set as the entityId of the tab configuration... For reference, see [Identifiers in Planner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/planner-identifiers-disclaimer?view=graph-rest-1.0)
- fixed: Tabs created in wrong private channels [#441](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/441)
  - updated code to reflect the new graph schema
- changed: Template Store: SEO, social sharing and categories
  - Header Metadata
    - Automatically generated by this VuePress plugin: https://github.com/webmasterish/vuepress-plugin-autometa
    - The Template Store is now optimized for SEO through automatically generated meta, for instance:
      ```html

  - Benefits
    - Improved operations & availability
      - Decorrelates our infrastructure from the public domains and urls, enabling our new [Microservices Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices).
      - Reduce downtime by enabling [hot-patching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)#HOT-PATCHING) of our container instances
      - Managing redundency is easier as Front Door provides an global HTTP load balancing with instant failover across pools of containerized instances
      - SSL certificates are now 100% automatically managed by Front Door, reducing our maintenance workload and risks of unexpected expiration / invalidation
    - Increased performance
      - Users are automatically routed to the closest available backend
      - Static assets can now be cached and served from [Azure CDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/) across the multiple [Azure PoP Worldwide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-pop-locations)

- changed: Isolation of tech-hub and template-store repos and websites
  - Why: Previously, sites "tech-hub" and "template-store" were hosted in the main "app-platform" repo, resulting in longer build times and possible issues.
  - How: Now techhub and template-store sources are hosted in their own isolated repos:
    - tech-hub:
      - New [Repo](https://github.com/nboldhq/tech-hub)
      - The website is still available [here](https://developers.salestim.com/), and is hosted right from the repository through the GitHub Pages service.
    - template-store:
      - New [Repo](https://github.com/nboldhq/template-store)
      - Now hosts both .json templates and the template-store website
      - The store website is now available [here](https://store.salestim.com/) instead of `prd.salestim.io/store`
      - N.B: The [template-gallery](https://github.com/nboldhq/template-gallery) repo previously hosting .json templates is now archived and should not be used anymore
- fixed: Fallback language for sv-SE generates i18n errors [#135919](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/135919)
  - How: Added a specific fallback entry for sv-se in `i18nConfig.js`
- added: Support of spanish language

- changed: Increasing membership limits
  - Now you can select up to 20:
    - Requested owners & members in the new team request form
    - Permanent owners & members in the template settings
- changed: Improved user selection
  - Why: It's sometimes hard to select users from directories when there is a large number of users sharing the same first or last name
  - How: In user selection box (approvers selection from a template, permanent members...), filtering is now performed on the following fields:
    - givenName
    - surname
    - email
    - userPrincipalName
- changed: The "approval" tab in templates is now flagged with a "Pro" badge
- fixed: Error updating mail nickname. (PRD) [#121353](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/121353)

- fixed: email naming conventions
  - Replace accentuated characters using Lodash Deburr function (see https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#deburr)
  - Deburrs string by converting [Latin-1 Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement_(Unicode_block)#Character_table) and [Latin Extended-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Extended-A) letters to basic Latin letters and removing combining [diacritical marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_Diacritical_Marks).
- changed: Updated doc "Service Account" and "Data Management Practices" sections
- fixed: Unexpected error in /sameSiteMiddleware/ensureCookieCompatibility. [#120782](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/120782)

  - Why: https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/
  - How:
    - Implementation of a new middleware (sameSiteMiddleware)
    - Set express to trust the first proxy
      ``` javascript
      app.set('trust proxy', 1) // trust first proxy
      // @see http://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html
      ```
    - Define cookie policy in express session
      ``` javascript

    ``` javascript
    { msPreferredLanguage: null }
    ```
  - Background: Default templates (Basic EN and Basic FR) relies on this property for audience targeting
  - Impacts: Default templates were not visible by these users
  - Resolution: Now when checking the audience targeting, if the ``` msPreferredLanguage ``` property is empty, it is dynamically filled with (Ordered by priority):
    1. Microsoft Teams language
    2. Browser language
    3. ``` en-us ``` in last resort

- fixed: Error in getGeneralChannelId: Failed to execute Skype backend request GetThreadsRequest. [#5917](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/5917)
  - Detail: {"statusCode":500,"code":"GeneralException","message":"Failed to execute Skype backend requestt..."}
  - Root cause: Microsoft Graph may send a 500 error sometimes
- fixed: Microsoft Graph error status code
  - The Microsoft Graph api sometimes generates error status code as a "status" property, sometimes as a "statusCode" property
- fixed: Microsoft Planner API throttling
  - Related issue: graphHelper/getPlannerPlanDetails error: {"status":429,"response":{"req":{"method":"GET","url":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/planner/plans/REDACTED","headers":{"user-agent":"no (DEV) [#5263](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/5263)
- fixed: Microsoft Graph Error 404 in function: waitForTeamsAsyncOperation with arguments (PRD) [#5419](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/5419)
  - Root cause: Sometimes, there is a delay between starting cloning a team and the moment where you can call the /operations endpoint
  - Solution: In case of error 404, try to replay call to /operations later
- ops: Issues are now affected to different teams depending on their type.
  - For instance:
    - CSM: admin consent approval, service account issues
    - OPS: Generated audit trails and logs 
    - DEV: Exceptions
- improvement: Microsoft Graph inner exceptions
  - Sometimes, the Microsoft Graph api returns internal errors or misleading error messages, such as:
  ``` javascript
  {
    "req":{"method":"POST","url":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/planner/plans","data":"",
    // ...
    "status":403,
    "text":"{\r\n "error": {\r\n "code": "",\r\n "message": "You do not have the required permissions to access this item, or the item may not exist.",\r\n "innerError": {\r\n "request-id": "REDACTED",\r\n "date": ""\r\n }"
  }
  ```

## [1.2.25]

- improvement: Email naming convention
  - If the email naming convention results in an empty address, the generated team name is now used instead.
- fixed: Service account token expiration after 90 days
  - Error message: The refresh token has expired due to inactivity.
  - Error log:
    ``` javascript
    "status":400,
    "text":"{\"error\":\"invalid_grant\",\"error_description\":\"AADSTS700082: The refresh token has expired due to inactivity. The token was issued on XXXTXXXZ and was inactive for 90.00:00:00.",\"error_codes\":[700082]\"error_uri\":\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/error?code=700082\"}"
    ```
  - Error code: https://login.microsoftonline.com/error?code=700082
  - Root cause: After 90 days, the refresh token used to get a new access token for the service account is expiring automatically. For the first 90 days, the newly acquired refresh token was used but not persisted.
  - Resolution:
    - Each access token refresh now persists the new refresh token
    - A scheduled job renews service accounts token daily
- improvement: Service Account initialization
  - The first Office 365 administrator to login is now used as the default service account.
- fixed: User names case is now preserved in Intercom


## [1.2.23]

- improvement: Notifications messages localization [#231](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/231)

    - The associated template language.
    - As a first-level fallback the requester language
    - As a second-level fallback to 'en-us'
- fixed: Error in postProcessRequest: {} (DEV) [#4634](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/4634)

- improvement: During the provisioning process, cloned Planner tabs are now configured to use the user language [#213](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/213)
  - Planer tab configuration now respects the following scheme:
  ``` javascript
  {
    contentUrl: 'https://tasks.office.com/[TENANT_ID]/Home/PlannerFrame?page=7&planId=[PLAN_ID]&auth_pvr=Orgid&auth_upn={upn}&mkt={locale}'
    websiteUrl: 'https://tasks.office.com/[TENANT_ID]/Home/PlanViews/[PLAN_ID]'
    removeUrl: 'https://tasks.office.com/[TENANT_ID]/Home/PlannerFrame?page=13&planId=[PLAN_ID]&auth_pvr=Orgid&auth_upn={upn}&mkt={locale}'

## [1.2.21]

- fixed: Planner plan creation error [#4192](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/4192)
  - When a Graph api internal error occurs during the creation of a Planner plan, the function that handles the creation of a new audit log may fail due to an empty callback. [#4195](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/4195)


## [1.2.20]

- improvement: nBold's publisher domain validation by Microsoft
  - Configuring the publisher domain has an impact on what users see on the app consent prompt.
  - Especially, an application’s publisher domain is displayed to users on the application’s consent prompt to let users know where their information is being sent.
  - [Implications on the app consent prompt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-configure-publisher-domain#implications-on-the-app-consent-prompt)
- improvement: "My Requests" popup
  - Larger popup (max width to 1140px)
- fixed: In some edge cases (misconfigured tabs or tabs in an inconcictent state), the wrong number of tabs is shown in audit trail.


## [1.2.19]

- ops: Better client-side error tracking
  - If an error arises client side (teams client or browser), the following tags are automatically populated:
    - Before login:
    ``` Javascript
    [
      'alert',
      'browser',
      environment,
      loginHint, // Usually user email
      teamSiteDomain, // *.sharepoint.com
      tid // tenant id
    ]
    ```
    - After login:
    ``` javascript
    [
      'alert',
      'browser',
      environment,
      msEmail, // user email
      msTenantInitialDomainName, // Tenant initial domain name
      msTenantDefaultDomainName, // Tenant default domain name
      tid // tenant id
    ]
    ```
- fixed: Teams photo update changes the request status
  - Context: The photo update process may last for a long time due to the asynchronous Exchange Mailbox provisionning process it depends on.
  - Previous behavior: If the photo update happens after the "Teams Provisionning Done" event, it changes the request status to "processing" after the "done" event.
  - New behavior: The "photo updated" audit log entry now doesn't change the request status, therefore it will be seen as:
    - "Processing" or "Post-Processing" if the photo update happens before the "done" event
    - "Done" if the photo update happens after the "done" event
- fixed: Better management and reporting of edge cases during provisionning
  - Handles properly unconfigured tabs (Website, Planner...)
  - Handles properly deleted channels
  - Handles teams without any tab
  - Handles Planners plans without buckets and buckets without tasks
  - Zero requested members or owners
  - Zero permanent members of owners
  - Better audit logs for tabs processing:
    - Each tab shows the tab type and name
    - The tabs summary shows the number of processed tabs
  - New log message when an error occurs in tab provisionning (including unsupported tab)
  - Cleaner tab names in audit trail (URL decode)
  - New all tabs configured message (even if a tab is in error)


## [1.2.17]

- fixed: i18n: Incorrect translations with Indian english locale (en-in)
- ops: Asynchronous Jobs Engine
  - This new scheduler is meant to execute scheduled batch processes in a secured environment
  - Supports different execution environments and schedules for dev, uat, ppr and prd
  - Follows the [CRON syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) for scheduling, including second-level scheduling
  - Jobs are defined using the following JSON representation:
    ``` javascript
    {
      id: 'JOB_ID',
      description: 'JOB_DESCRIPTION',
      module: 'MODULE_PATH',
      environments:
        [
          dev, uat, ppr, prd
        ],
      schedule:
      {
        dev: '- - - - *',
        uat: '- - - - *',
        ppr: '- - - - *',
        prd: '- - - - *'
      },
      options: {JOB_OPTIONS}
    }
    ```
    - Jobs should be implemented as a regular nodejs module, exporting a 'start' method with the following prototype:
    ``` javascript
    /*- 
     - Module main entry point
     - @param {string} logFile - Relative log file path
     - @param {function} Callback - (err, res, msg)
     */
    let myJob = (options, (err, res, msg) => {
      // Job implementation
    })
    exports.start = myJob
    ```
    - Jobs execution history are persisted at regular intervals as csv audit trails files and in our GiHub ops repository as issues with the 'jobs' tag, as serialized objects:
    ``` javascript
    let taskExecutionRecord =
    {
      jobId: 'JOB_ID', // String
      startDate: 'START_DATE', // Date
      endDate: 'END_DATE', // Date
      duration: 'EXECUTION_DURATION', // Int, as ms.
      succeeded: EXECUTION_RESULT, // Boolean
      message: 'EXECUTION_MESSAGE', // String
      errorPayload: 'ERROR_PAYLOAD', // String (Stringified JSON)
      successPayload: 'SUCCESS_PAYLOAD', // String (Stringified JSON)
    }
    ```
- fixed: Log files persistance from Windows containers
  - Handling both "\" and "/" path separators
- fixed: Missing requests from the "My requests" page
  - Root cause: For certain users, the number of requests returned from our cache may vary
  - Resolution: Fix the SCAN Redis operations
- fixed: Error generating team logo [#2409](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/2409)
  - Now using the "teams" Microsoft Graph beta API endpoints
- improvement: Team photo update in requests audit trail
  - Now the "Team photo updated" event is visible in audit trail as part of post-processing operations
- fixed: Random error in team photo update
  - Root cause: Trying to update the underlying group photo of a team just after its provisioning may fail as the related Exchange Mailbox may not be fully provisioned yet (required to store group photo)
  - Resolution: Handling specific returned error codes and implement a retry mechanism
- refactor: Microsoft Graph SDK
  - Using the nodejs Microsoft Graph SDK instead of native REST requests for streams operations (binary files, photos updates...)
- improvement: Users without profile pictures
  - For users without profile pictures, our front-end dergrades gracefully, hiding the user profile picture zone without unnecessary latency.
- fixed: Permanent membership missing information in audit trail
  - Permanent membership notifications in audit trail are now showing members and owners names individually
- refactor: Our mail module is now abstracted from its service provider implementation
- refactor: Our GitHub module is now fully independent and dependency free


## [1.2.15]

- improvement: Template management analytics
  - Tracking a new event on user profile 'template_created' and 'template_updated' with the following metadata:
    ``` javascript
    {
      template_id: REDACTED,
      template_name: REDACTED
    }
    ```
  - Tracking a new attribute on company profile 'template_count' (# of templates)


## [1.2.14]

- fixed: Analytics Events
  - References:
    - Error creating analytics event [#2322](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/2322)
    - fixed: Events: "Template Created" event is not raised [#271](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/271)
    - fixed: Intercom exception: Multiple existing users match this email address REDACTED [#255](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/255)
  - Fixes:
    - user email and id are now forced to lower case to prevent duplicates
    - Intercom user id is now based on: 
      - user upn in identified mode (in teams without beeing authenticated yet)
      - user email in authenticated mode (in teams authenticated)
    - Intercom company id is now based on tenant initial domain name (*.onmicrosoft.com)
    - Intercom company name is now based on tenant initial domain name (*.onmicrosoft.com)
    - Tracking a new event on user profile 'serviceaccount_updated' with the following metadata:
      ``` javascript
      {
        serviceaccount_id: REDACTED,
        serviceaccount_name: REDACTED,
        serviceaccount_upn: REDACTED
      }
      ```
    - Tracking new attributes on company profile:
      - 'company_customer_id': nBold internal customer id
      - 'serviceaccount_initialized': Initialized to 'true' the first time a service account is defined [#259](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/259)
- fixed: Planner cloning exceptions in case of empty planner or empty buckets
  - Error in allTasksProcessed: {} [#1139](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/1139)
  - Error in allTasksProcessed: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined [#2076](https://github.com/nboldhq/Ops/issues/2076)
- improvement: Better anomaly tracking. The following exceptions are now properly logged and surfaced with a meaningful message in audit log:
  - **400_INVALIDREQUEST_MAILNICKNAME**:
    - Message: The generated email address for this team is empty or incorrect...
    - Explanation: The naming convention applied to this template has generated an invalid email address for the underlying group related to the team. For instance:
      - The total prefixes, address and suffixes string length is restricted to 53 characters.
      - Avoid using the following characters in your email policy: #, [, ], <, and >
    - Required action: Fix the template's naming conventions
    - Processing behavior: The provisioning process is stopped and flagged in an "error" stage
  - **400_INVALIDREQUEST_TABSWITHOUTAPPS**:

    - Required action: Either:
      - Restore the deleted team
      - Associate template with another team
    - Processing behavior: The provisioning process is stopped and flagged in an "error" stage
  - **403_ACCESSDENIED_TEAMSLICENSES**:
    - Message: nBold Service account doesn not have Teams licences...
    - Explanation: The service account defined in nBold's settings doesn't have the required licenses to access Microsoft Teams
    - Required action: Add the required Microsoft Teams licences to your service account
    - Processing behavior: The provisioning process is stopped and flagged in an "error" stage
  - **504_UNKNOWNERROR_INNERERROR**:
    - Message: Microsoft Graph. An unknown error occured during processing on Microsoft Servers...
    - Explanation: An error occured on Microsoft servers during a Microsoft Graph operation.
    - Required action: None
    - Processing behavior: The provisioning process will automatically retry the operation after a few seconds until is works properly


## [1.2.13]

- ops: Logging improvements
  - Log files are now rotated every 14 days
  - Now generating an audit trail of file logging operations:
    ``` javascript
    {
        "date": "REDACTED",
        "name": "REDACTED.log",
        "hash": "REDACTED"
    }
    ```
- fixed: 2 teams created per Request [#247](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/247)
  - The "Send request" button is now disabled immediately while processing the request to prevent double clicks
  - Better "click" handlers to prevent multiple registrations
- fixed: Messages in 2 different languages appear on the same page [#260](https://github.com/nboldhq/app-platform/issues/260)
- improvement: Locale is now set using a fallback mechanism, that uses the following order of priority to determine the right locale to be used:
  1. From Microsoft Teams context (Language defined in the Microsoft Teams client)
  2. From the browser client language
  3. Set to en-us in any other case
- improvement: Locale is now detected and updated during each request.
  - Therefore you can update the language of your Microsoft Teams client, and you don't need to logout from nBold to see change.
- feat: Template Language
  - You can now associate a language with each template, within the following list:
    - en-au
    - en-bz

  - Browser infos
  - Teams Context
  - Screenshot
- security: Self-hosted fonts.
  - Now all fonts resources are loaded from the nBold platform instead of using Google Fonts CDN
  - Not necessarily a security issue, but:
